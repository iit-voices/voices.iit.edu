Since our town was a manufacturing city with large factories, people were very scared. And a week&#39;s time, two weeks later when the German was already [there], we could not make a go of it in that small town so that we had to return to the [our] town. Soon during the journey we were stopped by Germans and searched. The little property [belongings] that we had was taken away from us on the road and distributed among the Poles, the Gentiles. And afterwards, when we came back to the town, we did not find anthing in the house any more. Everything had been taken out, and everything had been robbed by other neighbors. And in the town there were very few people. Soon on the next day, it was on &#39;Yom Kipper,&#39; coming out next morning, the synagogue was already no more. We saw already it is in flames. That old synagogue that had been standing for years and years was lit up in flames. In the middle of the night, in the middle of the night on the second day, the synagogue was still burning. As propaganda, people had to take the rabbi and sign that the synagogue had been set on fire by ourselves. And we had to save [fight the fire] by ourselves. And who...and whoever came out to [try and] save the synagogue, they were beaten with terrible beatings, and also a few people were shot. And later on, when there had already passed a long, quite a long time, they were then...the Jews were then separated from the... from the Poles. The Jews had to live then in special houses on special streets where no Pole was allowed to enter. And soon there began very hard living conditions. And afterwards, after quite a long time, there was...there was...there was...issued an order from the German authorities that all Jews have to wear the bands. And [he] who does not have a band on his arm, he receives &#39;ten years&#39; punishment, or else be shot [?] on the spot. Many cases happened when a Jew in that crowded ghetto, where he was living and could not sustain himself and his family, was forced to go out on the...on the forbidden streets. And many times it happened that Jews out of luck were shot, and half a year later an order came out that everyone from eighteen to forty-five has to report to the Jewish council...council. The next day at eight o&#39;clock in the morning all the Jews in the town reported and [were] led out to a square, guarded by Germans, and there we stood without eating or drinking a whole day. In the evening, herded like cattle into RR-cars and shipped away. Many people, one may say...report that fifty per cent remained there in the lager...

Were you there with those people?"},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "677.723","u": "No. Just my brother."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "679.462","u": "What?"},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "680.501","u": "My brother was with those people."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "682.270","u": "But you were not there?"},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "684.611","u": "I was not.

It was not so strict yet. It was in the beginning of 1940. It still could succeed. During all that time we experienced very hard conditions at home, and altogether...and afterwards, when I ...when I was...when an order had been given that children from twelve years have to go to work for the Germans, every day..."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "739.305","u": "Hm."},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "739.943","u": "Without wages, without pay, and also to get beaten.

He took us, eight boys, to him...to work for him, to work for him. We would work very diligently. He would stand and watch. All at once he comes over, gives us a Nagan in the hand and says, &#39;Beat your comrade!&#39; I take [it] and beat him. He says, &#39;that is not how one beats,&#39; takes that Nagan out of my hand, and gives me such a hard blow that I could not lift my hand any more. He says to me, &#39;That is how one beats Now will you know? Now beat your comrade.&#39; In such a...in such a way they tried to liquidate us in the quickest manner. And afterwards he took...and said..."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "802.907","u": "What is a &#39;Nagan&#39;? [Nagan is the make of a revolver.

We were terribly tormented, and we endured very bad times. All of a sudden there began arriving in our town..."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "876.125","u": "That was in your town?"},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "877.572","u": "In &#39;your&#39; town."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "878.272","u": "And..."},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "878.462","u": "In Starachowice."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "879.253","u": "And..."},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "879.527","u": "Starachowice."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "880.501","u": "And at night we went home to sleep?"},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "882.787","u": "And at night we went to sleep. When we went home to sleep, the oldest...a father I did not have. The mother, to earn for bread she could not, because she had to stay only on the streets that had been assigned. And on the other streets where the Christians, the Gentiles, were living we could not go out on any more, and so it was very hard, that life. Returning home at night, sometimes I would find a potato without salt, and sometimes there was not even that. And early in the morning, again with the same hunger, return to the same work that a hundred per cent...fifty per cent, one can say, I did not expect to return, because [one was] without strength and getting beaten very much. All of a sudden Jews from all over begin to arrive in our town. There begins a traffic with autos, with trains. From all over Jews begin arriving. And so what is going on? There is a bustle in the town. People are being resettled. People are being resettled from all the towns to Treblinka from where people do not return any more, the death lager which is known all over the world, Treblinka. We are thinking about a way out, but there is no way out. Thus it was going on for two weeks. One bright...bright morning a five o&#39;clock, the whole town is guarded, surrounded, and an order was given that in ten minutes not one Jewish child [son or daughter of Israel] is to be found in his home. And many Jews...and many Jews were prepared for it. We slept with the clothes on. [He used the word Ungetuigs for clothes which was not understood by the interviewer.]"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "984.915","u": "How did one sleep?"},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "985.965","u": "In the clothes.

We took that bundle and ran out at once. Coming out of the house, there were already waiting Germans with guns, with grenades in the hands."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1006.241","u": "Only children?"},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "1006.988","u": "Only...Germans. Everybody!"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1010.121","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "1010.266","u": "The whole family went out. The whole family came out of the house. There were already Germans waiting with grenades, with machine guns in the hands and looked for the moment to kill us. But we had...but we were following the order, and it did not last...did not take ten minutes to come out. Coming out on the street, I once more...I, myself, looked back once again at my house, and I said, &#39;This house I will not see again.&#39; We went out to the market place. This is a large square in the center of town. All the Jews were assembled there. Walking, we already saw how Jewish blood flows in the streets, and the bullets are flying. When we were already assembled on the square, we see an old couple walking. They have no more strength to drag their feet. So a German takes and leads [them] into a house and with one bullet he shot both of them. Put one next to the other, both heads, and shot both. Going ahead, looking around the town again, we see the children lost from their mothers and mothers lost from their children. They are calling, the mothers to the children and the children to the mothers. But those children whom the Germans had noticed, who had from great fright lost their mothers, died immediately on the spot. Such a panic lasted four, five hours. It was terrible. Also while standing in rows, the Germans came over and took off immediately everything, the better things. I myself was dressed in my best suit, my best clothes. They soon took off my jacket and my boots, and they asked if I do not have any money or anything else."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1128.676","u": "How old were you then?"},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "1130.413","u": "I was then fifteen years old when all that happened.

You are going with us. Whatever will happen to us will happen to you, too.&#39; At a short distance passed an SS man, and [he] immediately took off my jacket and a pair of boots. I remained barefooted. Luckily I had in my bundle a pair of old shoes that I had taken along. I put [them] on and stood dismayed, mornful, seeing what is happening to Jews. How the blood flows, and the little children taken by the feet and thrown against the wall. And later on when the afternoon came, everybody was tired standing on that square. There suddenly arrived an auto with five SS men. And they said for all young men from eighteen to twenty-five to fall in, to be taken to work. I was a boy of fourteen years. I did not have the chance to step forward. But suddenly an SS man was passing, and he took a liking to me. He gave me a sign with his revolver, and I had to step our from the ranks, and with a heavy...with an embittered heart I looked at the mother and left the ranks, [and was] incorporated into the ranks of the workers.

Arriving in the new lager, we were spread out in two places. We separately, and the women, very few, separately. When we where standing on that square an order came to hand over whatever we still had. All our things on one side and the rest that we have, to throw away. We went over to the other side. The things we left on the place on which we were formerly...standing before. And later on there arrived a few SS men and gave an order, &#39;In the name of our Fuehrer ten people will be shoot.&#39; And immediately ten people were selected.

And a few people going to be shot fainted instantly, and fell on the spot. And afterwards, when that &#39;action&#39; was finished, we were arranged in two rows and led by, past five SS men. The five SS men had the job of searching all our belongings. Tore our shirts, tore our shoes. The hair was searched. Wherever there might be a chance. They even looked under [the soles of] the feet if one had not pasted on any valuables with adhesive tape. Arriving in the new lager we were led into barracks. Those barracks were made entirely of wood, temporary barracks. We entered, a hundred people to a barrack. The barrack looked low. One little electric bulb. Three-tiered beds, without straw, without anything, just wood. [Words not clear. As I have explained...explained, everyone...two people received one little bed.

On that we had to sleep. When we entered that lager, the cries, the wailing of everybody was terrible. It looked like Tishe B&#39;ab [a fast day commemorating the destruction of the Temple], like Chorben Beth Hamigdash [Destruction of the Temple]. So it looked. Everybody was thinking about what had happened to the parents and to the other people who had remained there on that square. In such...in such a mood [?] we sat till the evening. The night fell slowly. It fell gradually, and everybody on the plank beds, bewildered, confused, brooding. There was no question of sleeping. The desire to sleep came to nobody&#39;s mind. I, as a young boy, sit and cry and complain. With whon did I remain? And what will I do? And what will the future be? Lost. There is no hope. I myself must summon courage that I should be able to live through that moment and be able to relate to the Jews all over, in every corner or the world, in each of the four corners of the world, what has happened to the...to us. The story, the times we have gone through. In the middle of the night everyone sits exhausted, in thoughts. Suddenly we hear a shot. Indeed [?] a guard, a Ukrainian, got a fancy and shot [burst] into our barrack. And there fell two badly wounded and three dead."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1705.807","u": "How can there fall two badly wounded and three dead from one shot?"},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "1709.617","u": "From a machine gun. It was a shot from a machine gun. And if all the bullets had found a mark, there would have been many more victims. But, thank God, it only cost three burned offerings and two wounded. And so, tacken aback by the dead and by the wounded, there was no councel or aid. We had no water. To go out was a threat of death. And so gradually with our own efforts we did whatever we could in order to alleviate their suffering, to reduce their plight. Dawn was nearing slowly. We all arose, and we wanted to go to work. We thought that if we remain lying they will take it for sabotage, that we do not want to go to work. So we all arose and went to work. [While the prisoners were] walking out through the door, the Ukrainians heard it. They immediately surrounded our barrack and fell upon us like murderers, with machine guns in the hands, and were beating with rubber truncheons. &#39;What do you think, you Jew? You band of Jews, what do you think, you have any way out of this lager? Here you must remain! Here you must croak! And your life you must end in this lager&#39; And with terrible blows they chased...chased us back into the lager. By six o&#39;clock in the morning there came in a Jew who was...who had been elected temporarily to take charge of the lager."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1805.245","u": "Who elected him?"},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "1806.749","u": "A Jew.

And he came in...he came into the block, and he told us to get dressed and go to work. In five minutes everybody was ready, because nobody had slept, nobody had undressed. Everybody was depressed, crush-...crushed by his...by his misfortunes, by his pain. [We were] arranged on the square and went to work Going out through the gate we received the bread which we took along among our things. Everyone received a slice of around ten dekas, five dekas. It depended on how much luck one had. And a little bitter, cold, unsweetened coffee. That was the first day of our going out to work. When we arrived at work...[when we were] entering the factory, the Ukrainians received us with bad beatings [?]. We were assigned to sections in Polish, &#39;Do wydzial&#39; [to work halls] where everyone was to work. We immediately got the worst kind of work. We, Jews children, were taken,of eighteen, or seventeen, of sixteen years, [and] assigned to ovens of two thousand degrees of heat. They made ammunition, cannon...shells for cannon. And who did not complete the &#39;norm&#39; like one says in Polish, that means the number that he was supposed to make--that was two thousand to three thousand shells--had to stand sixteen hours. And if I did not finish in sixteen hours, he [I?] Had to remain for twenty-four hours. That is how it was going on every day, the day by day work. In a short time very, very many people had fallen who did not have the strength to endure all those things. When the...when the Russians had come closer, [when] they came near the Vistula, the Germans considered it a danger if we should remain in the place, and we have to be sent away to [the interior of] Germany. At night there came an order that not one Jew is to go to work but has to remain in the place, on that spot, in the lager. A terrible fright gripped the whole lager. Everybody walked around brooding and said, &#39;Now [these] are our last moments. The Russians are approaching and the Germans knows that he has lost the war. He will finish us all off on the spot just where we are.&#39; Two three...two days this situation [?] lasted."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2031.409","u": "Which lager was that?"},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "2032.780","u": "In Starachowice."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2034.118","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "2034.735","u": "Two days..."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2034.999","u": "That is the town or the lager [?]?"},    {"who": "Kalman Eisenberg", "start": "2036.177","u": "That is the town and also the lager.

The section which is working from seven in the morning till three in the afternoon can still go to work. It became a little easier, but still people were still going around with the same fright. [The continuity seems disrupted.] Arriving at work, the Gentiles, the Christians, told us the terrible agony that was experienced by the people who had remained there on the square. Because until now we had had no information, and later on we had some information from people who had returned...who were taken as far as Treblinka and after that they returned. And part of those people [possibly Christians] were also working there in the factory, who were driving the wagons, the engines from on factory to another. An acquaintance, a Jew, was acquainted with such a machinist, and he told him about the terrible tortures that the Jews, those people had suffered, who had been taken away. First of all, a hundred and fifty people were packed into a small RR-car. Entirely closed, nailed shut, doused with chloride [chlorek]. And the bundles taken away, and the water they needed. And chased inside [the RR-cars], beaten up, grabbed bloody, herded into the RR-cars. That Christian reported the impossible thing that fifty per cent would arrive half alive at that place. He said that he is completely convinced that not a single Jew will [could] arrive at that place alive, not withstanding that the place as such was the death sentence. That means Treblinka. Returning from work, we heard that the guards had searched the entire plant [to see] whether, God forbid, a Jew did not hide himself there and escape at night into the forest and hide himself.

The police [apparently Jewish trusties] came into each barrack and said &#39;Jews, the last moments of our lives are approaching, and so we have one way out, to break out of the lager.

                    <p class="utterance">As soon as the Germans entered our town we left immediately for another town, a small town in which very few people lived. Since our town was a manufacturing city with large factories, people were very scared. And a week&#39;s time, two weeks later when the German was already [there], we could not make a go of it in that small town so that we had to return to the [our] town. Soon during the journey we were stopped by Germans and searched. The little property [belongings] that we had was taken away from us on the road and distributed among the Poles, the Gentiles. And afterwards, when we came back to the town, we did not find anthing in the house any more. Everything had been taken out, and everything had been robbed by other neighbors. And in the town there were very few people. Soon on the next day, it was on &#39;Yom Kipper,&#39; coming out next morning, the synagogue was already no more. We saw already it is in flames. That old synagogue that had been standing for years and years was lit up in flames. In the middle of the night, in the middle of the night on the second day, the synagogue was still burning. As propaganda, people had to take the rabbi and sign that the synagogue had been set on fire by ourselves. And we had to save [fight the fire] by ourselves. And who...and whoever came out to [try and] save the synagogue, they were beaten with terrible beatings, and also a few people were shot. And later on, when there had already passed a long, quite a long time, they were then...the Jews were then separated from the... from the Poles. The Jews had to live then in special houses on special streets where no Pole was allowed to enter. And soon there began very hard living conditions. And afterwards, after quite a long time, there was...there was...there was...issued an order from the German authorities that all Jews have to wear the bands. And [he] who does not have a band on his arm, he receives &#39;ten years&#39; punishment, or else be shot [?] on the spot. Many cases happened when a Jew in that crowded ghetto, where he was living and could not sustain himself and his family, was forced to go out on the...on the forbidden streets. And many times it happened that Jews out of luck were shot, and half a year later an order came out that everyone from eighteen to forty-five has to report to the Jewish council...council. The next day at eight o&#39;clock in the morning all the Jews in the town reported and [were] led out to a square, guarded by Germans, and there we stood without eating or drinking a whole day. In the evening, herded like cattle into RR-cars and shipped away. Many people, one may say...report that fifty per cent remained there in the lager... </p>

The mother, to earn for bread she could not, because she had to stay only on the streets that had been assigned. And on the other streets where the Christians, the Gentiles, were living we could not go out on any more, and so it was very hard, that life. Returning home at night, sometimes I would find a potato without salt, and sometimes there was not even that. And early in the morning, again with the same hunger, return to the same work that a hundred per cent...fifty per cent, one can say, I did not expect to return, because [one was] without strength and getting beaten very much. All of a sudden Jews from all over begin to arrive in our town. There begins a traffic with autos, with trains. From all over Jews begin arriving. And so what is going on? There is a bustle in the town. People are being resettled. People are being resettled from all the towns to Treblinka from where people do not return any more, the death lager which is known all over the world, Treblinka. We are thinking about a way out, but there is no way out. Thus it was going on for two weeks. One bright...bright morning a five o&#39;clock, the whole town is guarded, surrounded, and an order was given that in ten minutes not one Jewish child [son or daughter of Israel] is to be found in his home. And many Jews...and many Jews were prepared for it. We slept with the clothes on. [He used the word Ungetuigs for clothes which was not understood by the interviewer.]</p>

Coming out on the street, I once more...I, myself, looked back once again at my house, and I said, &#39;This house I will not see again.&#39; We went out to the market place. This is a large square in the center of town. All the Jews were assembled there. Walking, we already saw how Jewish blood flows in the streets, and the bullets are flying. When we were already assembled on the square, we see an old couple walking. They have no more strength to drag their feet. So a German takes and leads [them] into a house and with one bullet he shot both of them. Put one next to the other, both heads, and shot both. Going ahead, looking around the town again, we see the children lost from their mothers and mothers lost from their children. They are calling, the mothers to the children and the children to the mothers. But those children whom the Germans had noticed, who had from great fright lost their mothers, died immediately on the spot. Such a panic lasted four, five hours. It was terrible. Also while standing in rows, the Germans came over and took off immediately everything, the better things. I myself was dressed in my best suit, my best clothes. They soon took off my jacket and my boots, and they asked if I do not have any money or anything else.</p>

How the blood flows, and the little children taken by the feet and thrown against the wall. And later on when the afternoon came, everybody was tired standing on that square. There suddenly arrived an auto with five SS men. And they said for all young men from eighteen to twenty-five to fall in, to be taken to work. I was a boy of fourteen years. I did not have the chance to step forward. But suddenly an SS man was passing, and he took a liking to me. He gave me a sign with his revolver, and I had to step our from the ranks, and with a heavy...with an embittered heart I looked at the mother and left the ranks, [and was] incorporated into the ranks of the workers. Once more I wanted to turn and take a look at my mother. I soon got [it] with a riding crop over the head that to this day I still have a souvenir of that instant. </p>

Arriving in the new lager, we were spread out in two places. We separately, and the women, very few, separately. When we where standing on that square an order came to hand over whatever we still had. All our things on one side and the rest that we have, to throw away. We went over to the other side. The things we left on the place on which we were formerly...standing before. And later on there arrived a few SS men and gave an order, &#39;In the name of our Fuehrer ten people will be shoot.&#39; And immediately ten people were selected.

When we entered that lager, the cries, the wailing of everybody was terrible. It looked like Tishe B&#39;ab [a fast day commemorating the destruction of the Temple], like Chorben Beth Hamigdash [Destruction of the Temple]. So it looked. Everybody was thinking about what had happened to the parents and to the other people who had remained there on that square. In such...in such a mood [?] we sat till the evening. The night fell slowly. It fell gradually, and everybody on the plank beds, bewildered, confused, brooding. There was no question of sleeping. The desire to sleep came to nobody&#39;s mind. I, as a young boy, sit and cry and complain. With whon did I remain? And what will I do? And what will the future be? Lost. There is no hope. I myself must summon courage that I should be able to live through that moment and be able to relate to the Jews all over, in every corner or the world, in each of the four corners of the world, what has happened to the...to us. The story, the times we have gone through. In the middle of the night everyone sits exhausted, in thoughts. Suddenly we hear a shot. Indeed [?] a guard, a Ukrainian, got a fancy and shot [burst] into our barrack. And there fell two badly wounded and three dead.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">From a machine gun. It was a shot from a machine gun. And if all the bullets had found a mark, there would have been many more victims. But, thank God, it only cost three burned offerings and two wounded. And so, tacken aback by the dead and by the wounded, there was no councel or aid. We had no water. To go out was a threat of death. And so gradually with our own efforts we did whatever we could in order to alleviate their suffering, to reduce their plight. Dawn was nearing slowly. We all arose, and we wanted to go to work. We thought that if we remain lying they will take it for sabotage, that we do not want to go to work. So we all arose and went to work. [While the prisoners were] walking out through the door, the Ukrainians heard it. They immediately surrounded our barrack and fell upon us like murderers, with machine guns in the hands, and were beating with rubber truncheons. &#39;What do you think, you Jew? You band of Jews, what do you think, you have any way out of this lager? Here you must remain! Here you must croak! And your life you must end in this lager&#39; And with terrible blows they chased...chased us back into the lager.

And he came in...he came into the block, and he told us to get dressed and go to work. In five minutes everybody was ready, because nobody had slept, nobody had undressed. Everybody was depressed, crush-...crushed by his...by his misfortunes, by his pain. [We were] arranged on the square and went to work Going out through the gate we received the bread which we took along among our things. Everyone received a slice of around ten dekas, five dekas. It depended on how much luck one had. And a little bitter, cold, unsweetened coffee. That was the first day of our going out to work. When we arrived at work...[when we were] entering the factory, the Ukrainians received us with bad beatings [?]. We were assigned to sections in Polish, &#39;Do wydzial&#39; [to work halls] where everyone was to work. We immediately got the worst kind of work. We, Jews children, were taken,of eighteen, or seventeen, of sixteen years, [and] assigned to ovens of two thousand degrees of heat. They made ammunition, cannon...shells for cannon. And who did not complete the &#39;norm&#39; like one says in Polish, that means the number that he was supposed to make--that was two thousand to three thousand shells--had to stand sixteen hours. And if I did not finish in sixteen hours, he [I?] Had to remain for twenty-four hours. That is how it was going on every day, the day by day work. In a short time very, very many people had fallen who did not have the strength to endure all those things. When the...when the Russians had come closer, [when] they came near the Vistula, the Germans considered it a danger if we should remain in the place, and we have to be sent away to [the interior of] Germany. At night there came an order that not one Jew is to go to work but has to remain in the place, on that spot, in the lager. A terrible fright gripped the whole lager. Everybody walked around brooding and said, &#39;Now [these] are our last moments. The Russians are approaching and the Germans knows that he has lost the war. He will finish us all off on the spot just where we are.&#39; Two three...two days this situation [?] lasted.</p>

Because until now we had had no information, and later on we had some information from people who had returned...who were taken as far as Treblinka and after that they returned. And part of those people [possibly Christians] were also working there in the factory, who were driving the wagons, the engines from on factory to another. An acquaintance, a Jew, was acquainted with such a machinist, and he told him about the terrible tortures that the Jews, those people had suffered, who had been taken away. First of all, a hundred and fifty people were packed into a small RR-car. Entirely closed, nailed shut, doused with chloride [chlorek]. And the bundles taken away, and the water they needed. And chased inside [the RR-cars], beaten up, grabbed bloody, herded into the RR-cars. That Christian reported the impossible thing that fifty per cent would arrive half alive at that place. He said that he is completely convinced that not a single Jew will [could] arrive at that place alive, not withstanding that the place as such was the death sentence. That means Treblinka. Returning from work, we heard that the guards had searched the entire plant [to see] whether, God forbid, a Jew did not hide himself there and escape at night into the forest and hide himself. </p>

In the afternoon a decision was made by the Jews that from this lager we have to get away. Should we remain till next morning there are definite rumors that we will be shot. At night everyone was awake. No one slept. The police [apparently Jewish trusties] came into each barrack and said &#39;Jews, the last moments of our lives are approaching, and so we have one way out, to break out of the lager. And not far from the lager there is a forest. It is quite certain that many Jews will fall but this cannot be helped. Who will remain alive...whoever will be able to save his life will remain alive. And if we shall do nothing, the entire lager will perish. There is no place where we could be taken. There is no place, and the Germans will not let us live. It is an impossible thing that they will let us live.&#39; At night, everything ready, a little bundle in the hand, with hammers, with pliers, with axes, [we] went over to the...eh...went over to the wires. There was no strong guard. And so on all four side Jews were standing and watched for the moment to be able to go over, tear out the fence and escape into the forest. Thus it lasted four, five, ten minutes. After that there came people running from all four sides and breaking the boards and cutting the wires. And a few people running from all four sides and breaking the boards and cutting the wires. And a few people succeeded in escaping. At the same moment fire began falling from all four roofs, from the towers where the guards stood, and many, many were shot and a very small part escaped into the woods. But the majority of Jews were afraid to risk [it] and did not have the possibilities any more of running over to the fence and running away, because death awaited them immediately.</p>

Throughout the night on that square the guards were milling with the grenades, with arms in the hands. Finally we saw the dawn. So we were allowed to go out to wash, and back again into the barrack.
