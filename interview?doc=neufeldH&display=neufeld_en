On September 17, 1939, Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland and overran large parts of the country including the large industrial and cultural center of Lwow (Ger. Lemberg).
Lwow had a Jewish community in 1939 of approximately 110,000 making it the third largest Jewish community in Poland.

In four days of killing, approximately 4,000 Jews were murdered. From July 25-27, the Ukrainians carried out another pogrom this time murdering a further 2,000.

It began as a prisoner of war camp but had five satellite camps among which was one for Jews from Poland who had papers issued by various countries mainly in Latin America. As Mrs. Neufeld subsequently indicates, the prisoners in this satellite camp did not have to engage  in forced labor and conditions were at first better than those elsewhere in Belsen. The deportation of some 1,700 prisoners from this satellite camp to Auschwitz did indeed occur in October 1943.

            When Bergen Belsen was liberated by British troops on  April 15, 1945, there were some 58,000 surviving inmates and 10,000 corpses. Anne Frank and her sister had died about a month before of typhus and were buried in a mass grave. The survivors were suffering from extreme malnutrition and virulent diseases such as tuberculosis, dysentery and typhus. Nearly 14,000 died in the two months following the liberation of the camp.

            World War II began with Germany's attack on Poland on September 1, 1939. On September 28, 1939, Warsaw, Poland's capital, surrendered, and in the early days of October the last battles were fought. On September 17, 1939, Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland and overran large parts of the country including the large industrial and cultural center of Lwow (Ger. Lemberg).
Lwow had a Jewish community in 1939 of approximately 110,000 making it the third largest Jewish community in Poland. Mrs. Neufeld was one of the some 100,000 Jewish refugees from German occupied western Poland who fled to the city.

            The Soviet German war began on June 22, 1941 with the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The Germans routed Soviet forces in the early weeks of the invasion and rapidly captured Lwow, which fell on June 30, 1941.

            There had been a great deal of antisemitism in Lwow in part because the Poles and Ukrainians in the city each accused the Jews of helping the other. The murder of Jews began on the same day as the German occupation with Germans and Ukrainians taking part. The Lwow pogrom lasted from June 30 to July 3, 1941. In four days of killing, approximately 4,000 Jews were murdered. From July 25-27, the Ukrainians carried out another pogrom this time murdering a further 2,000. Only a handful of the Jews of Lwow survived the war.

            The Germans established the Lwow ghetto in November/December 1941. 5,000 sick and elderly Jews were killed during the move to the ghetto.

            Folk German (volksdeutsche) was the Nazi term for an ethnic Germans residing outside of Germany who was a national in their country of residence. Nazi Germany received a good deal of support from these individuals in countries such as Poland.

            The Warsaw ghetto was established in mid November 1940. It was surrounded by a high wall topped by jagged shards of glass and sealed off from the "Aryan" section of the city. Mrs. Neufeld was fortunate in finding an opening in the wall through which she could enter the ghetto and rejoin her family. Perhaps the opening had been made by those who smuggled food into the ghetto.

            The mass deportation from the Warsaw ghetto began on July 22, 1942 and lasted until September 12 of that year. During this time, more than a quarter of a million Warsaw ghetto Jews were deported to the Treblinka extermination camp where they were murdered by gas.

            From the outbreak of the war, Warsaw experienced German air raids, but the antiaircraft defenses of the city were crippled after the first week. The Germans then bombed the city at will and many Warsaw residents perished. German artillery also indiscriminately shelled the city.

            <a name="note_10"></a>
            In place of the traditional Jewish Community Council of the city, the Germans installed a Judenrat. It was this body that carried out their orders. Adam Czerniakow, head of the Warsaw Judenrat, committed suicide rather than sign the order for deportation that was couched in the usual deceptive language employed by the Germans. Obviously, Mrs. Neufeld and her family resisted German blandishments by doing everything possible to avoid deportation.

            The mortality rate in the Warsaw ghetto was atrocious. The monthly death toll from June 1941 through April 1942 fluctuated from 4,000-5,500. At its height in March 1941, there were about 445,000 inhabitants of the Warsaw ghetto. By the time of the beginning of deportations in July, 1942, the population had shrunk by more than 100,000 in what can only be described as gradual extermination. Jewish medical personnel tried to stem the death rate as best they could, but, as Mrs. Neufeld indicates, they were often helpless in the face of acute shortages of food and medicine.

                <li>
            <a name="note_12"></a>
            When the first phase of deportations ("the first action") ended in September 1942, there were about 35,000 Jews who remained legally  in the ghetto and about 25,000 who were there illegally.

            The Germans launched a second wave of deportations on January 18, 1943 but were met with Jewish armed and passive resistance. The deportations were halted after a few days but not before they managed to seize 5,000-6,000 Jews.

            <a name="note_14"></a>
            Mrs. Neufeld's escape, as was the case with so many others, was most fortuitous. She was among the more than 25,000 Jews hidden by sympathetic Poles in "Aryan" Warsaw.

            The uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, the most sustained and famous Jewish revolt during the Holocaust, began on April 19, 1943, the eve of the Passover holiday.

            Despite the German use of tanks, artillery and aircraft, the fighters in the Warsaw ghetto fought courageously for about one month. The civilian population hid in ingeniously constructed underground bunkers throughout the ghetto. The Germans burned every building in the ghetto to the ground in an effort to quell the rebellion, but it took them about one month to do so, more time that it had taken them to conquer some European countries.

            Bergen Belsen was established in July 1943 so Mrs. Neufeld was there almost from its inception. It began as a prisoner of war camp but had five satellite camps among which was one for Jews from Poland who had papers issued by various countries mainly in Latin America. As Mrs. Neufeld subsequently indicates, the prisoners in this satellite camp did not have to engage  in forced labor and conditions were at first better than those elsewhere in Belsen. The deportation of some 1,700 prisoners from this satellite camp to Auschwitz did indeed occur in October 1943.
350 more were deported to Auschwitz in early 1944. Mrs. Neufeld and, as she will later reveal, her husband, who had been sent to Belsen with her, were among the several hundred who remained in the camp. Just why they were spared is unknown.

            Irma Grese, a female camp supervisor, was known as "the bitch of Belsen" due to the inhuman cruelty she displayed towards the prisoners. She was sentence to death for her crimes by a British military court and hanged in December 1945 at the age of twenty one.

            Josef Kramer was appointed commandant of Bergen Belsen on December 2, 1944. Before his appointment, he worked in other concentration camps including Auschwitz where he became known for his ruthless and sadistic behavior. He was tried by a British military court, sentenced to death and hanged on December 12, 1945 at the age of thirty nine. Adolf Hass and Siegfried Leidle preceded Kramer as Auschwitz commandants.

            Pawiak prison was located in the Jewish quarter of Warsaw. It was the main prison used by German security forces in the Warsaw district from October 1939 to August 1944 and was known for the harsh conditions under which prisoners were incarcerated. Pawiak held a number of Jewish prisoners caught on the "Aryan" side of Warsaw such as Mrs. Neufeld.

            Conditions in Bergen Belsen deteriorated steadily in 1944 and underwent a profound deterioration from January through March of 1945 as thousands of prisoners on death marches from other camps were sent there resulting in chaotic conditions and the spread of infectious diseases. At its height in March 1945, the typhus epidemic in Belsen claimed more than 18,000 lives. From January 1945 to mid April of that year, some 35,000 prisoners perished and were buried in mass graves.

            Theresienstadt (Czech, Terezin) was a ghetto established by the Germans in northwest Czechoslovakia. It was liberated by the Red Army on May 8, 1945. 33,000 Jews perished in Theresienstadt, and 88,000 were deported from there to extermination camps.

            It is not clear whether or not Mrs. Neufeld's husband was with her in hiding in "Aryan" Warsaw or in Pawiak prison though this was probably the case. It is also not clear why the couple was transferred to the satellite camp at Belsen for those who had papers from foreign countries in their possession. It is quite plausible that the Neufeld's had such papers, but the interview does not reveal to where.

            Had Mrs. Neufeld and her husband been liberated in Bergen Belsen and remained there, they would have become part of the largest Displaced Persons camp in Europe after the war. Located in the British zone of occupation of Germany, the Displaced Persons camp at Belsen had a largely self-governed and self contained Jewish community Jewish community from 1945-1950. The DP camp focused on the physical and spiritual rehabilitation of the survivors, the search for relatives, and the political struggle for rights and immigration to Palestine and then the State of Israel.

            Mrs. Neufeld might have been alluding to romance languages. She indicated earlier that she was very fond of the French language in her Warsaw gymnasium.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.

            When Bergen Belsen was liberated by British troops on  April 15, 1945, there were some 58,000 surviving inmates and 10,000 corpses. Anne Frank and her sister had died about a month before of typhus and were buried in a mass grave. The survivors were suffering from extreme malnutrition and virulent diseases such as tuberculosis, dysentery and typhus. Nearly 14,000 died in the two months following the liberation of the camp.

            World War II began with Germany's attack on Poland on September 1, 1939. On September 28, 1939, Warsaw, Poland's capital, surrendered, and in the early days of October the last battles were fought. On September 17, 1939, Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland and overran large parts of the country including the large industrial and cultural center of Lwow (Ger. Lemberg).
Lwow had a Jewish community in 1939 of approximately 110,000 making it the third largest Jewish community in Poland. Mrs. Neufeld was one of the some 100,000 Jewish refugees from German occupied western Poland who fled to the city.

            The Soviet German war began on June 22, 1941 with the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The Germans routed Soviet forces in the early weeks of the invasion and rapidly captured Lwow, which fell on June 30, 1941.

            There had been a great deal of antisemitism in Lwow in part because the Poles and Ukrainians in the city each accused the Jews of helping the other. The murder of Jews began on the same day as the German occupation with Germans and Ukrainians taking part. The Lwow pogrom lasted from June 30 to July 3, 1941. In four days of killing, approximately 4,000 Jews were murdered. From July 25-27, the Ukrainians carried out another pogrom this time murdering a further 2,000. Only a handful of the Jews of Lwow survived the war.

            The Warsaw ghetto was established in mid November 1940. It was surrounded by a high wall topped by jagged shards of glass and sealed off from the "Aryan" section of the city. Mrs. Neufeld was fortunate in finding an opening in the wall through which she could enter the ghetto and rejoin her family. Perhaps the opening had been made by those who smuggled food into the ghetto.

            The mass deportation from the Warsaw ghetto began on July 22, 1942 and lasted until September 12 of that year. During this time, more than a quarter of a million Warsaw ghetto Jews were deported to the Treblinka extermination camp where they were murdered by gas.

            From the outbreak of the war, Warsaw experienced German air raids, but the antiaircraft defenses of the city were crippled after the first week. The Germans then bombed the city at will and many Warsaw residents perished. German artillery also indiscriminately shelled the city.

            In place of the traditional Jewish Community Council of the city, the Germans installed a Judenrat. It was this body that carried out their orders. Adam Czerniakow, head of the Warsaw Judenrat, committed suicide rather than sign the order for deportation that was couched in the usual deceptive language employed by the Germans. Obviously, Mrs. Neufeld and her family resisted German blandishments by doing everything possible to avoid deportation.

            The mortality rate in the Warsaw ghetto was atrocious. The monthly death toll from June 1941 through April 1942 fluctuated from 4,000-5,500. At its height in March 1941, there were about 445,000 inhabitants of the Warsaw ghetto. By the time of the beginning of deportations in July, 1942, the population had shrunk by more than 100,000 in what can only be described as gradual extermination. Jewish medical personnel tried to stem the death rate as best they could, but, as Mrs. Neufeld indicates, they were often helpless in the face of acute shortages of food and medicine.

            The Germans launched a second wave of deportations on January 18, 1943 but were met with Jewish armed and passive resistance. The deportations were halted after a few days but not before they managed to seize 5,000-6,000 Jews.

            Despite the German use of tanks, artillery and aircraft, the fighters in the Warsaw ghetto fought courageously for about one month. The civilian population hid in ingeniously constructed underground bunkers throughout the ghetto. The Germans burned every building in the ghetto to the ground in an effort to quell the rebellion, but it took them about one month to do so, more time that it had taken them to conquer some European countries.

            Bergen Belsen was established in July 1943 so Mrs. Neufeld was there almost from its inception. It began as a prisoner of war camp but had five satellite camps among which was one for Jews from Poland who had papers issued by various countries mainly in Latin America. As Mrs. Neufeld subsequently indicates, the prisoners in this satellite camp did not have to engage  in forced labor and conditions were at first better than those elsewhere in Belsen. The deportation of some 1,700 prisoners from this satellite camp to Auschwitz did indeed occur in October 1943.
350 more were deported to Auschwitz in early 1944. Mrs. Neufeld and, as she will later reveal, her husband, who had been sent to Belsen with her, were among the several hundred who remained in the camp. Just why they were spared is unknown.

            Irma Grese, a female camp supervisor, was known as "the bitch of Belsen" due to the inhuman cruelty she displayed towards the prisoners. She was sentence to death for her crimes by a British military court and hanged in December 1945 at the age of twenty one.

            Pawiak prison was located in the Jewish quarter of Warsaw. It was the main prison used by German security forces in the Warsaw district from October 1939 to August 1944 and was known for the harsh conditions under which prisoners were incarcerated. Pawiak held a number of Jewish prisoners caught on the "Aryan" side of Warsaw such as Mrs. Neufeld.

            Conditions in Bergen Belsen deteriorated steadily in 1944 and underwent a profound deterioration from January through March of 1945 as thousands of prisoners on death marches from other camps were sent there resulting in chaotic conditions and the spread of infectious diseases. At its height in March 1945, the typhus epidemic in Belsen claimed more than 18,000 lives. From January 1945 to mid April of that year, some 35,000 prisoners perished and were buried in mass graves.

            It is not clear whether or not Mrs. Neufeld's husband was with her in hiding in "Aryan" Warsaw or in Pawiak prison though this was probably the case. It is also not clear why the couple was transferred to the satellite camp at Belsen for those who had papers from foreign countries in their possession. It is quite plausible that the Neufeld's had such papers, but the interview does not reveal to where.

            Had Mrs. Neufeld and her husband been liberated in Bergen Belsen and remained there, they would have become part of the largest Displaced Persons camp in Europe after the war. Located in the British zone of occupation of Germany, the Displaced Persons camp at Belsen had a largely self-governed and self contained Jewish community Jewish community from 1945-1950. The DP camp focused on the physical and spiritual rehabilitation of the survivors, the search for relatives, and the political struggle for rights and immigration to Palestine and then the State of Israel.
