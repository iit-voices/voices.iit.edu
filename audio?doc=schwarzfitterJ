Nu . . ."},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "49.343","u": "[In Yiddish] My name is Jacob Schwarzfitter, born in Olkusz [name not clear] the 29th of January 1916."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "57.522","u": "So how old are you now?

Now Mr. Schwarzfitter will you please tell me where you were, where did you live, when the war started, and what happened to you since then."},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "75.094","u": "When the war started I was a Polish soldier. My active military service I spent on the battlefield. The 19th of September that is when the war was in its 19th day, I fell prisoner to the Germans. From there I was taken with many thousands of prisoners to Germany. From there I was taken with many thousand prisoners of war to Kutno, and they held us in a small building, five thousand prisoners of war crowded in. Without water, without the least sanitary requirements. Bread we got&#226;hundred fifty gram [about 5 oz.] a day. We were given a bit of bran, and without water, without salt. That was the treatment [the fair]. [Footnote 1: He endeavors to speak German, or possibly his Yiddish has become altered due to prolonged contact with Germans. This leads often to an inappropriate choice of words. &#226;D.P.B.]"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "124.819","u": "Were there Polish soldiers also with you, Christian soldiers."},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "127.734","u": "There were with me together also Christian soldiers.

The conditions were very bad. Soon they started to separate the Jews. We were eight Jews in one c mpany among thirty thousand military prisoners. I was [sentence not clear]&#226;Polish Stalag A, at Altengrube, at Magdeburg. There we vegetated for a hard six months."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "180.574","u": "What does it mean&#226;vegetated?"},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "182.083","u": "Vegetated means we led a hard, bitter life. After six months, not according to our desire, but on the desire of the Wehrmacht, all Jews which belonged to the regions occupied by Germany had to be returned. And we were shipped home. En route&#226;we were &#34;discharged&#34; in Lublin. There they took off literally everything from all the military prisoners. The boots which I had because I belonged to the artillery were pulled off my feet. The overcoat, the coat, nothing was left but the pants and underpants, so they left me stand. Without a shirt. Winter. That was the second of March, 1940. There the custody was taken over by the Wehrmacht, SS, which was assembled from among the youth of Polish hoodlums and skum. There were youths of sixteen, seventeen years [of age], who did not know how to load the arms, but they knew how to shoot. And many were in that way murdered by them. There the conditions were exceptionally bad. Each day appeared like a year. After spending eight days in this lager, I arrived home. At home I still found everybody alive. But every Jew was already wearing the all-known Jew-star. There were already streets on which Jews were not permitted to walk."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "303.567","u": "What was the name of your [little] town, where you had come."},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "306.223","u": "I had come to my [little] town Olkusz. That&#39;s my place of birth. There I remained until the evacuation [depopulation] of the town. Before speaking about the depopulation, I shall narrate, report one incident. On the 31st of July 1940, there took place a punitive expedition against my town. On an early morning at four o&#39;clock, at daybreak, on a Wednesday, the whole town was aroused from sleep and put on its feet. And all men without distinction, Jews, from sixteen to fifty years of age, were taken out to various squares. They were taken out by the Gestapo. A few thousand Gestapo.man arrived, in a town which had a population of only about fifteen thousand, and they started punitive expedition."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "363.835","u": "Why was there a punitive expedition?"},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "365.973","u": "The punitive expedition took place because sixty dilometers from the city were murdered by bandits two gendarmes. But they felt it useful to make of it a political incident. And it was ordered to make responsible for it the peaceful [civilian] population. We were led out at daybreak, with our hands up, they jabbed us with bayonets and we were compelled to run. When we arrived at the square, we had to pass a cordon. On both sides stood SS men, with [metal] rods, belts, rubber truncheons, clubs, [?] and they beat us. Every one had to go through. People went through the cordon, and emerged covered with blood."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "415.581","u": "Women too?"},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "416.595","u": "No women. Women were not taken, that time, only men. Then afterwards each had to show his fingerprint. After giving his fingerprint [it is possible that they had to surrender their identification cards which bore a single fingerprint] each one was tripped from the front over a leg a thrown down to the ground. We were made to lie on the stomach, the face deeply pressed to the earth, with the hands on the back. So we remained lying until twelve o&#39;clock. And the SS men were passing back and fro, and when it pleased him he trampeled [the person]. I personally was hit several times with the boot on the head. At twelve o&#39;clock they came . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "456.390","u": "Twelve o&#39;clock noon?"},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "457.495","u": "Twelve o&#39;clock noon, after lying for eight hours we were ordered to get up. Everyone was pale and black. Wo all looked like dead men. So there spoke to us a gestapo man in the Polish language, while another explained [interpreted]. That we are being treated most humanely, because they are still able to prove who is against God and against humanity. I and those others present, could of course, not understand that people could be treated still, worse, but that we have learned in the future."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "500.841","u": "Now . . ."},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "502.036","u": "Afterwards he explained to us the reason for the event. It was because two gendarmes were murdered. Among those present was a Polish &#39;prister&#39; [the word was not clear, and caused a question]."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "519.088","u": "&#39;Prister&#39; is what, a policeman?"},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "520.960","u": "No &#39;Prister&#39; is a priest, a clergyman."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "524.117","u": "Oh, a [in German] &#39;priester&#39;?"},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "524.859","u": "Yes. He explained among other things, that those here present are not criminals, that they are simply peaceful citizens. For that he was murderously beaten . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "536.690","u": "Who, the priest?"},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "537.385","u": "The priest, because he dared to say such a thing."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "541.296","u": "Nu . . ."},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "542.987","u": "And after . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "543.488","u": "And the SS were Germans?"},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "544.544","u": "The SS were Germans, and also many Folk-Germans."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "551.727","u": "Yes. What do you call . . . What do you mean by Folk-Germans?"},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "553.357","u": "Folk-Germans, that means Poles who later had declared, saying that their forefathers, their grandmothers had something in common with German blood [ancestry]."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "564.735","u": "Yes . . . Nu . . ."},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "567.380","u": "Afterwards by two o&#39;clock there came the moment when they ordered all the people to disperse. I want still to make one remark. When they came into our house, we had a scroll of the Torah [holy scroll]."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "583.424","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "584.481","u": "And the SS man came and ordered to open the Torah, and then he asked us whether we still believe in God. So I asked him, why should one not believe? So he said, that at a time when so much evil is done to you, and nothing happens to us, so where is your God? So I involuntarily exclaimed&#226;something will still happen to you."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "606.893","u": "What did he say?"},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "607.889","u": "He said, why doesn&#39;t anything happen to us [to the Germans]. So I said it will still come to happen."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "611.652","u": "Nu . . ."},    {"who": "Jacob Schwarzfitter", "start": "612.588","u": "But he still left me alone. [It also could mean: he still left it&#226;the Torah&#226;with me].

The 19th of September that is when the war was in its 19th day, I fell prisoner to the Germans. From there I was taken with many thousands of prisoners to Germany. From there I was taken with many thousand prisoners of war to Kutno, and they held us in a small building, five thousand prisoners of war crowded in. Without water, without the least sanitary requirements. Bread we got&#226;hundred fifty gram [about 5 oz.] a day. We were given a bit of bran, and without water, without salt. That was the treatment [the fair]. [Footnote 1: He endeavors to speak German, or possibly his Yiddish has become altered due to prolonged contact with Germans.

                    <p class="utterance">In Germany after six weeks as war prisoners we got for the first time some water to wash up a bit. The conditions were very bad. Soon they started to separate the Jews. We were eight Jews in one c mpany among thirty thousand military prisoners. I was [sentence not clear]&#226;Polish Stalag A, at Altengrube, at Magdeburg. There we vegetated for a hard six months.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">Vegetated means we led a hard, bitter life. After six months, not according to our desire, but on the desire of the Wehrmacht, all Jews which belonged to the regions occupied by Germany had to be returned. And we were shipped home. En route&#226;we were &#34;discharged&#34; in Lublin. There they took off literally everything from all the military prisoners. The boots which I had because I belonged to the artillery were pulled off my feet. The overcoat, the coat, nothing was left but the pants and underpants, so they left me stand. Without a shirt. Winter. That was the second of March, 1940. There the custody was taken over by the Wehrmacht, SS, which was assembled from among the youth of Polish hoodlums and skum. There were youths of sixteen, seventeen years [of age], who did not know how to load the arms, but they knew how to shoot. And many were in that way murdered by them. There the conditions were exceptionally bad. Each day appeared like a year. After spending eight days in this lager, I arrived home. At home I still found everybody alive. But every Jew was already wearing the all-known Jew-star. There were already streets on which Jews were not permitted to walk.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">I had come to my [little] town Olkusz. That&#39;s my place of birth. There I remained until the evacuation [depopulation] of the town. Before speaking about the depopulation, I shall narrate, report one incident. On the 31st of July 1940, there took place a punitive expedition against my town. On an early morning at four o&#39;clock, at daybreak, on a Wednesday, the whole town was aroused from sleep and put on its feet. And all men without distinction, Jews, from sixteen to fifty years of age, were taken out to various squares. They were taken out by the Gestapo. A few thousand Gestapo.man arrived, in a town which had a population of only about fifteen thousand, and they started punitive expedition.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">The punitive expedition took place because sixty dilometers from the city were murdered by bandits two gendarmes. But they felt it useful to make of it a political incident. And it was ordered to make responsible for it the peaceful [civilian] population. We were led out at daybreak, with our hands up, they jabbed us with bayonets and we were compelled to run. When we arrived at the square, we had to pass a cordon. On both sides stood SS men, with [metal] rods, belts, rubber truncheons, clubs, [?] and they beat us. Every one had to go through. People went through the cordon, and emerged covered with blood.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">No women. Women were not taken, that time, only men. Then afterwards each had to show his fingerprint. After giving his fingerprint [it is possible that they had to surrender their identification cards which bore a single fingerprint] each one was tripped from the front over a leg a thrown down to the ground. We were made to lie on the stomach, the face deeply pressed to the earth, with the hands on the back. So we remained lying until twelve o&#39;clock. And the SS men were passing back and fro, and when it pleased him he trampeled [the person]. I personally was hit several times with the boot on the head. At twelve o&#39;clock they came . . .</p>

                    <p class="utterance">Twelve o&#39;clock noon, after lying for eight hours we were ordered to get up. Everyone was pale and black. Wo all looked like dead men. So there spoke to us a gestapo man in the Polish language, while another explained [interpreted]. That we are being treated most humanely, because they are still able to prove who is against God and against humanity. I and those others present, could of course, not understand that people could be treated still, worse, but that we have learned in the future.</p>

Our KZ was dissolved [?] the 9th day of May, 1944. [The apparent disruption of continuity is his own]. There [?] life was still somewhat tolerable. We had a good cavalry commander, that is we had an SS man who was in a compulsory manner, dragged over from the old guard regiments into the SS. He did not permit any chicanery. This lasted until the start . . . until the start of the offensive from the East. With the forward push of the Russian troops, when they arrived on the other side [??] of the Oder, . . . then they started to evacuate our concentration camps. We left the eleventh of February, 1945. We left under the roar of cannons, the shouting of the Russians. The Russians already fired over the city. A few hours later the city was occupied. But we have been already led away by the SS. En route, the first few hours were rather quiet. We stayed overnight fifteen kilometers from the town in the nearby village. There a few men tore themselves away from our column.

So I asked him what happened, what was the cause that he remained. So he explained to me. For six weeks he still has been working. At mealtime they gave there four hundred grams of bread, but the bread was full of sawdust mixed with wood shavings. So he explained that after six weeks he did not work anymore, but the block-elder would write down that he had gone to work, and he would give to the block elder hundred and fifty grams [of his bread ration].</p>

Because it does not exist, it is not worth the economic strength and the political strength. We have seen it ourselves. So, in Poland we also had rich Jews. And they went the same way as the poor ones. For that reason, you [the Americans] should help us, if there is still a certain measure of conscience in you, so we could build our own abode. We do not want to push aside anybody, [three words, not clear]. We want to transform the desert in good vineyards we want to create for ourselves a healthier future [?], a better future [?] for our people and for our generations to come, and to help to assure peace for all humanity [a long pause].</p>
