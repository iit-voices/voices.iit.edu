            Ms. Benmajor was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Once they left the Birkenau quarantine, prisoners were registered, received numbers which were tattooed on their left arm and then left for forced labor in Auschwitz or one of its sub camps. Camp authorities registered 405,000 prisoners of different nationalities in this way.

            Nazi Germany invaded Greece on April 6, 1941 as part of the effort to secure its southern flank in preparation for the invasion of the Soviet Union. Salonika fell to the Germans on April 9, 1941.

            Given the ages of Ms. Benmajor and her siblings, it is difficult to imagine that her parents were only thirty-eight and forty. Boder mistakenly thought that the Germans had conquered Greece in 1942. Ms. Benmajor would have indeed been sixteen years old in that year which would have made her twenty at the time of the interview, the age Boder says she was in his concluding remarks.

            Transports of Jews from Salonikia arrived in Auschwitz-Birkenau from March 20 to August 18, 1943. At least 48, 850 were deported. They were told they would be "resettled"  and had no idea of the horrible fate that awaited them at the end of their journey. Most were gassed upon arrival. Some 7,000 men and 4,200 women, among them Ms. Benmajor, survived the initial selection. The great majority of these died later. These statistics illustrate the uniqueness of Ms. Benmajor's survival.

            In 1946, Palestine was controlled by Great Britain which barred entry to Jewish refugees. Ms. Benmajor's brother was considered an illegal refugee by the British.

            <a name="note_8"></a>
            What Boder meant by  "stay alive" was that there was a chance of survival since the large majority of those who arrived in the camp were sent to the gas chambers immediately and were not included in any kind of registration. Ms. Benmajor's, "no",  relates to the fact that even those who were registered faced difficult odds in order to survive.

            There are other prisoners who contend that most inmates of Auschwitz did not engage in this kind of theft and maintained a commitment to group solidarity and survival throughout their incarceration in the camp.

            Ravensbruck, the only major concentration camp for women, was established in 1938 and  was located fifty six miles north of Berlin. Ravensbruck had thirty four sub camps. Over 100,000 prisoners of various nationalities were imprisoned in Ravensbruck during the seven years of its infamous existence. As was the case in other camps, inmates suffered from malnutrition, illness, beatings and shootings. Tens of thousands perished in Ravensbruck.

            Ms. Benmajor describes a typical death march which became more and more common as the end of the war approached. Her subsequent testimony illustrates that many did not survive this terrible ordeal.

            Translator's Note: Boder uses "Flinte," the word for "shotgun," most likely he means rifle.

            Retzow today is a municipality in northeastern Germany in the Havelland district of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. During the war, it was a sub camp of Ravensbruck and held over 1,000 prisoners.

            Malchow  today is located on the river Elde in the Muritz district of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. During the war it too was a sub camp of Ravensbruck. It was built to house 1,000 women, but at the time of the Ms. Benmajor's arrival its population had grown to 5,000 women.

            Prisoners formed bonds with one another that increased their chances of survival through mutual aid. Especially in the waning days of the war, the Germans greatly feared the Russians, and many fled west in order to try to surrender to the Americans.

            Countless German civilians fled their homes to escape the advance of the Red army. Although Ms. Benmajor and the other prisoners were liberated by the Russians and treated well by them, they also wanted to flee to the American side.

            The fact that the newly released prisoners, who had suffered so many privations and afflictions, were willing to set out on a three week journey by foot to reach the American side dramatically demonstrates their great determination to do so.

            In the early chaotic days following Germany's defeat, hundreds of thousands of refugees were on the move across Europe. The Cold War, which divided the country between east and west and established the Iron Curtain, had not yet begun.

            Ms. Benmajor was among the some 40,000 Holocaust survivors who sought refuge in France in the war's immediate aftermath. The Red Cross along with both French and American refugee relief organizations helped to care for them. The key French organization was the Committee for Social Action and Reconstruction, and the key American organization was the Joint Distribution Committee.

            The "affidavit" was a sworn assurance by family or friends who were American citizens that they had the financial means to care for the would -be immigrant so that he or she would not become "a public charge."

            The highly discriminatory United States refugee quota system, finalized in 1924, was still in effect. This racist system limited the number of refugees from southern and eastern Europe in favor or those from northern and western Europe.

            Boder is most likely referring to Mrs. Eda Button, who was interviewed previously on Spool 26.

            She obviously refers to the fact that many businesses are closed for the summer vacation during the month of August in France which makes it hard to find work.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.

The origin of the term has not been definitively established, though it has been attributed to a certain similarity to a prostrate Muslim in prayer.

            Ms. Benmajor was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Once they left the Birkenau quarantine, prisoners were registered, received numbers which were tattooed on their left arm and then left for forced labor in Auschwitz or one of its sub camps. Camp authorities registered 405,000 prisoners of different nationalities in this way.

            Given the ages of Ms. Benmajor and her siblings, it is difficult to imagine that her parents were only thirty-eight and forty. Boder mistakenly thought that the Germans had conquered Greece in 1942. Ms. Benmajor would have indeed been sixteen years old in that year which would have made her twenty at the time of the interview, the age Boder says she was in his concluding remarks.

            Transports of Jews from Salonikia arrived in Auschwitz-Birkenau from March 20 to August 18, 1943. At least 48, 850 were deported. They were told they would be "resettled"  and had no idea of the horrible fate that awaited them at the end of their journey. Most were gassed upon arrival. Some 7,000 men and 4,200 women, among them Ms. Benmajor, survived the initial selection. The great majority of these died later. These statistics illustrate the uniqueness of Ms. Benmajor's survival.

            What Boder meant by  "stay alive" was that there was a chance of survival since the large majority of those who arrived in the camp were sent to the gas chambers immediately and were not included in any kind of registration. Ms. Benmajor's, "no",  relates to the fact that even those who were registered faced difficult odds in order to survive.

            Ravensbruck, the only major concentration camp for women, was established in 1938 and  was located fifty six miles north of Berlin. Ravensbruck had thirty four sub camps. Over 100,000 prisoners of various nationalities were imprisoned in Ravensbruck during the seven years of its infamous existence. As was the case in other camps, inmates suffered from malnutrition, illness, beatings and shootings. Tens of thousands perished in Ravensbruck.

            Countless German civilians fled their homes to escape the advance of the Red army. Although Ms. Benmajor and the other prisoners were liberated by the Russians and treated well by them, they also wanted to flee to the American side.

            Ms. Benmajor was among the some 40,000 Holocaust survivors who sought refuge in France in the war's immediate aftermath. The Red Cross along with both French and American refugee relief organizations helped to care for them. The key French organization was the Committee for Social Action and Reconstruction, and the key American organization was the Joint Distribution Committee.

            The highly discriminatory United States refugee quota system, finalized in 1924, was still in effect. This racist system limited the number of refugees from southern and eastern Europe in favor or those from northern and western Europe.
