Rumkowski was heavily criticized for his relationship with the Nazis and his autocratic style of government. He oversaw the industrialization of the Ghetto, believing that the Nazis would spare the inhabitants of ÅÃ³dÅº if they remained productive in manufacturing goods for German consumption. While this productivity initially held off large deportations from the Ghetto, it did not last. Rumkowski and his family, along with approximately 60,000 remaining residents of the Ghetto, were deported to Auschwitz in the summer of 1944. He was murdered at Auschwitz on August 28, 1944.</span><sup><a href="#note_1">1</a></sup></note></span>

            Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski (1877-1944) was the Nazi-appointed head of the Jewish authorities in the ÅÃ³dÅº Ghetto. Rumkowski was heavily criticized for his relationship with the Nazis and his autocratic style of government. He oversaw the industrialization of the Ghetto, believing that the Nazis would spare the inhabitants of ÅÃ³dÅº if they remained productive in manufacturing goods for German consumption. While this productivity initially held off large deportations from the Ghetto, it did not last. Rumkowski and his family, along with approximately 60,000 remaining residents of the Ghetto, were deported to Auschwitz in the summer of 1944. He was murdered at Auschwitz on August 28, 1944.

            Hans Biebow (1902-1947) was the head of Nazi administration of the ÅÃ³dÅº Ghetto.

            Totenkopf is the German word for "skull." A design featuring a skull and cross-bones was part of the Nazi SS uniforms.

            Brin is slightly confused as to the dateâJanuary 17th was in fact a Wednesday. He likely means Thursday the 18th, as the Russians liberated ÅÃ³dÅº on January 19th, 1945.

During the war, some 43,000 people died there from starvation and disease. When the Russian army occupied Å&#195;dÅº in January 1945, only 877 Jews remained.

            Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski (1877-1944) was the Nazi-appointed head of the Jewish authorities in the ÅÃ³dÅº Ghetto. Rumkowski was heavily criticized for his relationship with the Nazis and his autocratic style of government. He oversaw the industrialization of the Ghetto, believing that the Nazis would spare the inhabitants of ÅÃ³dÅº if they remained productive in manufacturing goods for German consumption. While this productivity initially held off large deportations from the Ghetto, it did not last. Rumkowski and his family, along with approximately 60,000 remaining residents of the Ghetto, were deported to Auschwitz in the summer of 1944. He was murdered at Auschwitz on August 28, 1944.
