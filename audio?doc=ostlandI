My father was the local rabbi and slaughterer. He sent me to study first to the great Yeshiva of Ponevezys with the Ponevezys Rabbi Caneman; afterwards in the great Yeshiva of Telsh under Rabbi Bloch whose son-in-law I have now become."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "155.417","u": "Now, Rabbi, will you please tell me where you were and what happened to you when the war started?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "164.181","u": "When the war started I happened to arrive by accident with a group of Yeshiva people from the Yeshiva of Telsh in [the city of] Telsh, because we had to abandon the hamlet Shiblovo where the Yeshiva of Telsh was located. We had to get out of there on account of significant events, so we arrived in Telsh. And from Telsh, on a Sunday, the day when the war started, we escaped to Krishek [I am not sure of the exact name]. There we found a second group of the Yeshiva of Telsh and from there we departed for Russia."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "194.741","u": "Excuse me. Why did people have to go away from there?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "198.306","u": "There was a Polish Yeshiva in the hamlet Rasein [I am not sure of the name] which the Soviets wanted to send away to Siberia. But the members of the Yeshiva dispersed into the neighboring hamlets and when they were unable, in gathering them together, to distinguish who are the Polish Yeshiva people and who are the Lithuanian [Yeshiva people] we stood pat [the expression apparently meant that &#34;we would not betray them&#34;] and that is why we had to get away from there."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "221.576","u": "Go on."},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "222.400","u": "When we arrived in Telsh Sunday morning and hearing that war was declared by Hitler - cursed be his name - we all got terribly scared, we did not know what to do now. We, the young ones, have decided to run away to Russia but my father-in-law, the Rabbi of Telsh, with the other members of the Yeshiva remained unfortunately there. My wife too was there and she reports the following:"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "250.922","u": "Were you already married then?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "253.001","u": "No."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "253.516","u": "No."},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "255.726","u": "[She] tells that on Friday evening all Jews were called together in Telsh near the lake [he did not pronounce clearly this word].

So that the rest should be able to understand what they were talking about. Rabbi Bloch bravely stepped forward from the [assembled] congregation [one word not clear]. The German representative reproached him that the Jews were sniping through the windows at the Germans, and for that reason the Jews are being threatened with severe punishment. Rabbi Bloch endeavored strongly to prove the meaninglessness of such an accusation; he explained how alien such action is to the Jews. There occurred some other incident in the negotiations but that was not reported to the community. When Rabbi Bloch returned from the negotiations to the congregation there took place a little meeting of the heads of the community . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "329.970","u": "[The last two words were given in Hebrew and the interviewer asked for their meaning.]"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "330.802","u": "That means the representatives [of the Jewish inhabitants] of the city."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "333.467","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "334.905","u": "As a result of this meeting Rabbi Bloch presented himself before the community and talked to them in very severe terms and demanded from the community penitence. He explained that the only means to be saved in such a moment is a miracle. [the last two words are in Hebrew, I am not sure of the correct translation]. There is no natural way [to salvation]. He demanded from the community that they mend their ways with reference to three things; to preserve the purity of the family life, to observe the Sabbath, and to observe the dietary laws. This proposal was accepted by the community, and all like one, the pious and the free [thinkers], children and old ones, men and women, have resolved immediately to go through with it."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "372.730","u": "Which three things [the interviewer did not understand clearly the three Hebrew terms]?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "374.334","u": "The Sabbath, the dietary laws, and pure family life."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "378.077","u": "[The interviewer understood now the first two terms but inquired about the third one]."},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "379.336","u": "[Translating] pure family life."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "382.505","u": "Yes. Now continue."},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "386.346","u": "And then for no reason known to us there was all at once deferred the terrible sentence over the Jewish community of Telsh, which they had doomed to be exterminated; but the Germans permitted the women to go home immediately, while the men had to remain there overnight and afterwards they were led to a lager [camp] and for the time being nothing was done to them. The morning after they also called together the women and led them away to a different lager. The first lager, the one for the men, was located 4 kilometers from the city of Telsh. It was called Gerul, and the second lager was called Raim [the name is not clear]."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "429.866","u": "What were these lagers, back yards?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "431.046","u": "A kind of a farm. There they held the men for two weeks and during this time the three vows which they have pledged were not complied with and their doom was sealed [I am not sure of the correct translation of the last two worlds given in Hebrew]. In two weeks, it was on that gruesome day of Tammuz [a midsummer month of the Jewish calendar, usually the hottest month of the mid-European summer] the men were assembled one evening, and they were submitted to horrible, horrible torture. They cut off their beards and they forced the older people to dance the &#34;devils dance,&#34; they called it, and tortured and tormented them to the brink of death."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "472.177","u": "Who did this?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "473.238","u": "The Germans with the Lithuanian partisans."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "475.884","u": "Ah, the Germans together with the Lithuanian partisans."},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "477.856","u": "With the Lithuanian partisans."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "478.926","u": "Go on."},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "481.393","u": "They were informed that that was their last day, that they have time to live until next morning. The next morning . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "488.890","u": "Who told you that?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "490.229","u": "[as if continuing the sentence] . . . that was done by those terrible criminals who were standing around there, the Germans and the Lithuanians together."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "495.785","u": "But who told you all that?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "497.124","u": "My wife, the daughter of Rabbi Bloch, Khaje."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "499.528","u": "And how did she know about it, she wasn&#39;t with the men?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "502.807","u": "Yes . . . the children. She as a child of Rabbi Bloch . . . the children were then still with the men."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "509.975","u": "So. And the women were kept separate?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "512.253","u": "The women were kept separately. They were made to get up at five o&#39;clock in the morning under the pretext that they are being taken to work, but it was already known what kind of work expected them. Crowded by murderers they were led out about 200 meters from the lager and there began the terrible shootings at which my wife was already not present but the screams and the outcries of the shooting were heard in the lager where she was."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "548.469","u": "Who were taken, all men?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "549.887","u": "All men."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "550.849","u": "And they left the children?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "551.661","u": "They left the children but the men were shot near the ditch [common grave]. And one of these people who saved himself from among the men told later how from the ditch where Rabbi Bloch was lying, one heard the cry, &#34;Sma Ysreil&#34; [Hear, O Israel], because it was before daybreak, the time for Krishma [a special prayer for that hour], so he still recited the Krishma and his soul departed on the word Aekhod [the full sentence of the prayer reads: &#34;Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one&#34;]. The same thing happened the next day, caph aleph [the 21st]. That part of the men whom they had not managed to shoot caph Tammuz [Footnote: The tenth month of the Jewish calendar.] [the 20th of Tammuz] they shot on caph aleph Tammuz [the 21st]. The women who were in the second lager, that is 16 kilometers from Telsh . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "597.228","u": "Do I understand that they have taken the children with the men and the women separately?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "601.248","u": "The women were afterwards reunited with the children."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "603.676","u": "But from the start? [He talks at the same time as the interviewer and one cannot clearly understand what he is saying. The interviewees are often irritated by questions and do not permit the interviewer to finish the question but just talk simultaneously with him.] So at the start the children were with the men and the women were alone?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "606.817","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "608.136","u": "Go on."},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "611.257","u": "After a certain time has elapsed they came to the lager of the women and counted them up. The older ones and the very young ones they separated on one side and the young ones, that is the ones able to work . . . it became obvious immediately that those who are able to work have been granted a little bit more time to live and that those unfit for work are already doomed. My wife managed to extract her mother from among the unable to work into the group of able to work. And for that reason her mother with her other sisters returned to Telsh where there was created a ghetto which existed for a few months longer. During this time some of the younger ones and energetic ones managed to slip out of the ghetto, to hide among the Christians. They managed to live through the several years of war with them and those who remained alive are already by now . . . some of them in the land of Israel and some of them are in Poland."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "680.535","u": "How did they hide among the Christians, with Aryan papers?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "683.715","u": "With Jewish papers, because there could be found . . . although very few Christian families who were able to appraise the significance of saving a Jewish life. There were some who saved them with the purpose to convert to Christianity the children, and they did so later on . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "702.115","u": "So."},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "703.196","u": ". . . and that is the purpose why they saved them . . . but later of course, when the war was over the children were returned to the Jewish faith and remained pure and fine Jews."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "713.414","u": "Well, no let&#39;s return to the beginning. Where were you, and what happened to you?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "719.208","u": "Now, I myself was in Russia. For about four weeks . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "725.398","u": "How did you get away?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "726.519","u": "We came with a group of people from the Yeshiva of Telsh as far as the city of Mitau, a city in Latvia . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "731.600","u": "Oh yes, Mitau in Kurland."},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "733.897","u": "Yes.

How were you treated during the evacuation?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "753.121","u": "During the evacuation . . . we had something with us and en route others had to suffer a bit because things could not be properly arranged right from the start but as we got deeper into Russia the preparations [to receive us] were better."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "768.449","u": "But they did not take away from you your things?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "771.689","u": "We had no things with us because we abandoned our things en route, because it was hard on the way to Mitau, marching on foot so we had to abandon all our things and we traveled without anything."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "780.552","u": "What kind of railroad cars were they?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "782.069","u": "They were freight cars."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "784.794","u": "But they were kept open?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "786.707","u": "Open."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "787.531","u": "You could have air, you were permitted to go out?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "790.097","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "790.830","u": "You were able to go out, you could step out to satisfy your needs, you did not have to do it in the cars?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "799.305","u": "No. We would stop at stations and we could do everything satisfactory."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "806.140","u": "And you traveled to Kirov?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "808.310","u": "To the province of Kirov where we got to a little town, a village Vecheva.

We were working in a forest doing very hard work on lumber. And in general not being accustomed to physical work away from the [books of] Talmud, it was very hard for us. We lost a lot of strength. And we remained there until Sukkoth [the autumn Feast of the Tabernacles], observing all the Jewish traditions, dietary laws, and observance of the Sabbath. But in time we began to suffer, we had to get away from there because our physical strength did not permit us to remain at such hard labor."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "867.039","u": "Did you have with you the [volumes of] Talmud, did you have [with you] any books?"},    {"who": "Isaac Ostland", "start": "869.991","u": "No, no books. We only studied&#226;we had with us a little Tanakh-Pentateuch, Prophets and Writings.

These were Chaim Stein, Meyer Karonovitz, Meyer Zeligman. Then we also received the sad information about the other ten persons who were not alive any more.

Both the tendency to suppress even the thought of such sings referring in large measure to sex perversions on the one hand, while on the other hand the memories of the German inhumanities did not cease to haunt them, may also account for this repeated substitution of &#34;Bechuckotay&#34; for &#34;Ki Tahbo.&#34; No wonder that Rabbi Ostland, as well as his father-in-law, Rabbi Bloch, as so many pious Jews, were struck by the vivid resemblance between the castastrophe brought upon them by the Germans who evoked into reality above any measure, most of the macabre prophecies of the &#34;Takhakho Bechuckotay.&#34;] is being read.</p>

Like in those times there still take place maneuvers, military maneuvers and the destruction continues [I am not sure of the last few words]. Now about the other things. When afterwards the congregation began to grow in Vilna when the number of Jews increased, it became too crowded in number 19 German Street and it was decided to move to Zavalnya Street 35 to the Choral Synagogue. There we found two rooms adjoining the Choral Synagogue. There we established the congregation and after Rabbi Gutman left the town when he departed for Poland, we took over the rabbinate; also the shohets changed [in membership and personnel]. The parish developed rather well. It devoted itself to social service and it distributed during the course of the one summer &#39;45- [the congregation] distributed up to 100,000 rubles for the poor, for those who returned from lagers, for strangers who arrived. The parish also devoted itself with the reestablishment of Jewish life [I am not sure of the translation].
