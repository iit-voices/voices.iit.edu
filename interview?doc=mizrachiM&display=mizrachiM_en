            Salonika, the largest city in northern Greece, is also known as Thessalonika. It was second to Athens in population and as a seaport to Piraeus. Salonikia had a culturally  and religiously vibrant Sephardic Jewish community. It was the heart of the Sephardic world.

                <li>

            Mizrachi is derived from the Hebrew word, "mizrach", which means east.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_3"></a>
            Mr. Mizrachi at first inverted his first and last names. Boder then corrected him but used "Minis" instead of "Manis."

            The Freemasons were a secretive, liberal, humanitarian fraternal order. The Nazis persecuted the Freemasons in the belief that Masonic lodges were used by Jews in their quest for world domination and as such were a part of the Jewish world conspiracy.

            Some Jews from Salonika did flee to Athens which came under Italian control after the German conquest of Greece on June 2, 1941. The Italians treated the Jews humanely.

                <li>
            <a name="note_6"></a>
            Mr. Mizrachi's family spent some eighteen months of relative peace and quiet in Athens before the German occupation of that city in September 1943. Subsequently, Dieter Wisliceny, Adolph Eichmann's deputy, arrived in Athens with detailed plans for the destruction of the Jewish community of that city.

                <li>
            <a name="note_7"></a>
            Although the German raids were to prevent Jews going into hiding, many Athenian Jews did manage to hide with their Greek Christian neighbors despite the German penalty of death  for Greeks providing shelter. The Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek underground helped to hide a number of Jews.

            The German roundup of the Jews of Athens began in March 1944.

            <a name="note_9"></a>
            This exchange between Boder and Mr. Mizrachi is not entirely clear. Perhaps "pocket" meant "bucket" for waste which was then placed in the "piece of paper" and thrown out of the train every two days.

            Bergen Belsen concentration camp was named for the nearby town of Bergen. It was established in July 1943 and was originally intended for Jews whom the German government wished to exchange for Germans in Allied territory.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_11"></a>
            Later on in the interview, Mr. Mizrachi identified the capos as Polish Jews.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_12"></a>
            This was presumably the number under which Mr. Mizrachi was registered in Athens before boarding the deportation train.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_13"></a>
            These were Polish Jews who had papers in their possession issued mostly by South American countries.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_14"></a>
            Mr. Mizrachi probably means that those who were not capos lived collectively in the barracks behind the capos' rooms.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_15"></a>
            Since Mr. Mizrachi was deported to Bergen Belsen in April of 1944, he would have been incarcerated there for twelve months, not eighteen months. He and his family were deported from the camp in April, 1945 just prior to its liberation by the British army.

            Theresienstadt was the so-called "luxury camp" or "model ghetto" in which Jews, mainly from Bohemia and Moravia, Germany and Austria were not actually exterminated but died from hunger, torture, disease and beatings. Some 88,000 Jews were deported from Theresienstadt to extermination camps in Poland, notably Auschwitz. Towards the end of April 1945, the Germans brought thousands of prisoners to Theresienstandt who had been evacuated from other concentration camps in danger of being overrun by Allied forces. Mr. Mizrarchi and his family could have been among these evacuees had they not been liberated from their deportation train.

            Typhus is an acute infectious disease which in its epidemic form is spread from person to person by the body louse. As tens of thousands of prisoners poured into Bergen Belsen from camps in the east, a typhus epidemic raged in the early months of 1945 which claimed many thousands of lives, among them Anne Frank and her sister Margot.

                <li>

            Bergen Belsen was liberated on April 15, 1945.

            Spotted typhus is spread by mites and causes red spotting on the skin. With lice borne typhus, a characteristic rash appears over most of the body. It the latter variety of typhus, not "spotted typhus", with which Mr. Mizrachi and his parents were infected.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_20"></a>
            Mr. Mizrachi was an only child who "remained alone" since both his parents died of typhus, and he was an orphan.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_21"></a>
            The "machine" Mr. Mizrachi refers to was the train engine. According to testimony of American liberators of the train, the reason that the train was stopped and that the prisoners were able to capture some SS guards is that the train crew and other SS abandoned their posts as overwhelming American forces closed in.

            Farsleben is a village located just north of the city of Magdeburg in north central Germany in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. U.S. troops of the 743rd tank battalion and 119th regiment of the Ninth Army freed the more than 2,500 prisoners on the Mizrachi family's deportation train from Bergen Belsen on April 13th, 1945.

            This was the typical response on the part of German civilians. They expended a great deal of energy denying Nazi crimes and engaging in willful ignorance.

            The town of Hillersleben, also close to Magdeburg, was the site during the war of a large German air force (Luftwaffe) base. it was also the site of a large German weapons research center. It was most probably due to these reasons that there were hospitals in Hillersleben.

            The forlorn note on which the interview concludes is symbolic of the loneliness of so many survivors at the time who had lost so much of their previous lives and had to endure the large void which these losses created.

                Established in the spring of 1943 and initially intended as a transit camp, it soon was integrated into the concentration camp network.  Its population swelled late in the war as inmates from other camps further east were moved into it--from around 15,000 in late 1944 to 41,250 in March 1945.

                By November 24, 1941 the heart of Theresienstadt was turned into a walled ghetto. To the outside it was presented by the Nazis as a model Jewish settlement, but in reality it was a concentration camp. Theresienstadt was also used as a transit camp for European Jews en route to Auschwitz.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.

            Mr. Mizrachi's family spent some eighteen months of relative peace and quiet in Athens before the German occupation of that city in September 1943. Subsequently, Dieter Wisliceny, Adolph Eichmann's deputy, arrived in Athens with detailed plans for the destruction of the Jewish community of that city.

            Although the German raids were to prevent Jews going into hiding, many Athenian Jews did manage to hide with their Greek Christian neighbors despite the German penalty of death  for Greeks providing shelter. The Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek underground helped to hide a number of Jews.

            Theresienstadt was the so-called "luxury camp" or "model ghetto" in which Jews, mainly from Bohemia and Moravia, Germany and Austria were not actually exterminated but died from hunger, torture, disease and beatings. Some 88,000 Jews were deported from Theresienstadt to extermination camps in Poland, notably Auschwitz. Towards the end of April 1945, the Germans brought thousands of prisoners to Theresienstandt who had been evacuated from other concentration camps in danger of being overrun by Allied forces. Mr. Mizrarchi and his family could have been among these evacuees had they not been liberated from their deportation train.
