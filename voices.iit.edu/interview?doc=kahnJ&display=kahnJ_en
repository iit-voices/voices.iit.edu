Children didn't need special papers to enter the forbidden zone. And we were both under the age of 17 at the time and we could cross the German police barriers fairly easily where they were checking other person's papers. When we saw how impossible it was, since everyone refused to help us, even the guides who had been questioned were totally without any ideas as to what we could do, we returned to <a class="placename" href="#vothL334">Perpignan</a>, having decided to go it alone, without a guide, with no one's help. My brother bought a compass and an administrative road map of the area, and around noon, we left <a class="placename" href="#vothL334">Perpignan</a> for a small town called <a class="placename" href="#vothL335">Osseja</a>, located at.. what was the altitude? Located at 1200 meters above sea level. We had of course not succeeded in obtaining any papers giving us permission to be in the forbidden zone, and nevertheless, in the village of <a class="placename" href="#vothL335">Osseja</a>, we were already in the forbidden zone. Consequently, at any checkpoint, the Germans could have discovered that we were without papers and stop us from going any further. This didn't happen, fortunately, but coming out of the train station at <a class="placename" href="#vothL335">Osseja</a>, we saw two German agents who were checking papers for entrance into the forbidden zone. We stayed a few moments near the train tracks, and when we saw the two agents leave, we crossed through the train station and came out. We left behind two rather heavy backpacks and a suitcase, at the luggage checkroom, so that we would be less encumbered to look around, take a last look and explore the area.</span>

We started our climb towards the end of the afternoon, and the rain was falling, turning the ground into clumps of slush. We were sinking into the mud, dragging our feet, sliding. We were exhausted and not making any progress. [Question off mic from interpreter] We didn't dare take out the map, for fear it would become soaked and useless. From time to time, we looked at the compass to see if we were going in the right direction, and we would hear the German police dogs. We didn't know if they were tracking us or someone else, but we kept quiet so as to be missed by them. My brother, nevertheless, drove us on and pushed us as best as he could, because both my mother and I were more tired than he. Ultimately, he was the one who boosted the morale of the three of us, and who kept us on the right path with his compass. Coming out of the village, we saw a German barracks . . . where customs agents were housed, and we saw their big police dogs that were used to track people who tried to cross the border. Finally, after having walked for about 5 hours, we suddenly came upon train tracks at the bottom of a valley and we saw a little train station that looked very similar to our French train stations, and we wondered if we were already in Spain and not in France anymore. It was beginning to get dark and we didn't dare show ourselves and ask directions, or even approach the train station. Coming down from the mountain, we came up to a . . . what is that called? An embankment.<note n="7"><span class="note">In this case, the embankment was a raised structure to support the railroad tracks.</span><sup><a href="#note_7">7</a></sup></note> An embankment, and we had to cross under a tunnel, to go around the tracks and we finally made our way down to a highway that seemed like a major road, despite the fact that there wasn't much traffic. Finally, we approached the train station and we saw some writing [an inscription] that didn't seem to be French. It was [Filbas?], the equivalent of [biffure?] in Spanish.<note n="8"><span class="note">Possibly bifurcation, which meant railroad junction.</span><sup><a href="#note_8">8</a></sup></note> And then, little by little, we cautiously approached the train station and we heard some girls singing. They were not singing in French, but in Spanish. They ran off, a bit frightened, to find their father. Their father understood right away. Many people helped us, wiped our feet, gave us something to eat in this little train station. And the next morning—they obviously had given us their beds for the night—the next morning, we left very early to go to the province of <a class="placename" href="#vothL282">Barcelona</a>, which we were told was less dangerous, and from there, we couldn't be sent back to France.<note n="9"><span class="note">The province of Barcelona is located further south with its major city, the great Mediterranean seaport of Barcelona.</span><sup><a href="#note_9">9</a></sup></note> Starting at dawn, we had most likely walked all morning and a good part of the afternoon, and we were going to take a bus in a little village which was still up in the mountains, when we saw two Carabineros [in Spanish: customs officers], dressed in khaki uniforms with yellow belts and [rain?] hats. They came towards us, to ask for identification, documentation [in Spanish?] and we obviously had none to give them. They made us go to a hotel, the whole hotel having been requisitioned by them, and that's where the interrogation began, and where we were frisked. The interrogation lasted all afternoon. They would ask a question from time to time, show us some papers, confiscated everything we had. They collected everything we had in our pockets that we had tried unsuccessfully to hide from them. And finally, in the evening, they brought us a very copious dinner . . . for the modest price of 25,000 Francs, which was what they confiscated from us during the interrogation. At night, they put us in a room with bars on the windows, and before going to bed, they took our shoes.<note n="10"><span class="note">Obviously, so that the family would not attempt to escape. However, it does not appear that the Spanish authorities treated the Kahn family differently even though they were Jews.

            The German invaders broke the French defense lines near Sedan in northeastern France (Ardennes department). In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian war, Sedan was the scene of a disastrous French military defeat.

            The Kahns joined the great throngs of refugees fleeing south in the wake of the German invasion.

            On June 22, 1940, France signed an armistice with Germany near Compiègne in the same railway car where Marshal Ferdinand Foch, commander of  Allied forces in France in World War I, had handed his armistice terms to the defeated Germans in November 1918.

            The German occupation of southern France a month earlier had placed the Kahn family in additional danger.

            Perpignan is located not far from the Spanish border and the Mediterranean, some forty miles south of Narbonne in the area of France known as Roussillon, the French part of Catalonia.

                <li>
            <a name="note_6"></a>
            The Germans assumed direct control of the German border from the Vichy government beginning in April 1943. The authority of French police forces in this area was suspended in the special frontier zone they established. This is most probably what Jean refers to when he speaks about the "forbidden zone."

            The province of Barcelona is located further south with its major city, the great Mediterranean seaport of Barcelona.

            Obviously, so that the family would not attempt to escape. However, it does not appear that the Spanish authorities treated the Kahn family differently even though they were Jews. Indeed, there was no special discriminatory policy against Jewish refugees.

                <li>
            <a name="note_11"></a>
            Jean does not explain why the family was "miraculously" let out to join the convoy sailing for North Africa and to the city of Casablanca, the principal port of Morocco, located on the North African Atlantic seaboard. Morocco was then under French control.

            By the time the Kahns arrived in North Africa, the Allies had driven the Axis powers and their Vichy French allies out of the region including Algeria. The French North African colonies were under the rule of the Free French government headed by General Charles De Gaulle.
