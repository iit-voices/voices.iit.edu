In the camps, the SS could act with impunity towards the prisoners, give vent to their sadistic passion and exercise to the utmost their "will to power."

They were undertaken with the cooperation of the German armed services and various German firms such as I.G. Farben and the Behring works. SS doctors conducted tests with typhus, yellow fever, smallpox, cholera, diptheria, chemical warfare agents, phosphorus-rubber substances from incendiary bombs, poisoned ammunition, blood too old to be used on "normal patients" and other pathogens. Most subjects of these experiments died agonizing deaths. The most infamous of the experiments dealt with typhus in which hundreds infected with the disease perished.

            Hamburg was Germany's second largest city and its largest port. It had the fourth largest Jewish community in the country, a community that was vibrant and well-organized. Jews were well integrated into the life of this generally tolerant and progressive city.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_2"></a>
            Among the many pieces of anti-Jewish legislation enacted by the Nazis were measures barring Jews from various professions such as law and measures designed to make such occupations inaccessible in the first place by restricting Jewish admission to institutions of higher learning and preventing them from sitting for state examinations.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_3"></a>
            Responding to a move by the Polish government to deprive Polish Jews from the right of return from countries under German rule, the Germans drove some 17,000 Polish Jews into a no-man's-land between the two countries on October 28, 1938. The largest number were stranded near the border town of Zbaszyn.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_4"></a>
            Feuer is referring to the assassination of Ernst vom Rath by Herschel Grynszpan. 
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_5"></a>
            Grynszpan was not the cause of Feuer's family's expulsion to Poland. The expulsion took place on October 28, 1938, followed by the assassination on November 7, 1938.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_6"></a>
            The exact fate of Herschel Grynszpan has not been determined. After the fall of France, the collaborationist Vichy government turned him over to the Germans. Their plan to stage a show trial was not realized, and Grynszpan disappeared without a trace. It is not clear how he died, but it is almost certain that he did not survive the war.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_7"></a>
            The interview provides no information as to the fate of Feuer's parents.

                <li>
            <a name="note_8"></a>
            "It's not to be told in such a short time about the experience of someone in the concentration camp" is a poignant, gross understatement. The brutalities he and other inmates endured are beyond description.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_9"></a>
            Like so many other survivors, Feuer wanted to bear witness. He wanted the world to never forget the crimes of the Nazis.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_10"></a>
            The incident related by Feuer regarding the murder of his friend by the SS man reflects the mentality of the SS and the defenselessness of the prisoners. The SS were conditioned to behave with utter ruthlessness and brutality to those who were the supposed enemies of the "master race." These so-called enemies could be killed or exploited to serve the greater "racial good." In the camps, the SS could act with impunity towards the prisoners, give vent to their sadistic passion and exercise to the utmost their "will to power." When the SS man spoke to Feuer after he had murdered his friend, he was not speaking to a fellow human being but rather to an animate object or thing.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_11"></a>
            Feuer means "conscience." The SS were taught that pangs of conscience stemming from sympathy or compassion for their victims were signs of weakness that had to be stamped out.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_12"></a>
            These fictitious reasons for prisoners' deaths were also commonly used in the Nazis' euthanasia program.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_13"></a>
            Buchenwald had some 130 satellite camps, the most infamous of which was Dora. The camps employed hundreds of thousands of slave laborers who were often worked to death for the German war effort.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_14"></a>
            Construction on Buchenwald began in 1937 in a wooded area five miles from Weimar, the home of the noted German poet, Goethe, who supposedly rested and meditated under an oak tree, Goethe's oak. The oak was spared by the Nazis and designated the center of the camp, which was the antithesis of the humanistic and enlightened spirit of the poet and the democratic hopes on which the post World War I Weimar Republic was founded.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_15"></a>
            Feuer most probably means Jehovah's Witnesses. The Witnesses would not swear an oath of allegiance to the state and as pacifists would not serve in the armed forces. They were persecuted and victimized by the Nazis. In the camps, they were identified by a purple triangle.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_16"></a>
            The yellow triangle Feuer wore signified that he was a Jew. The red triangle signified that he was a also a political prisoner. Feuer did not reveal his political sympathies in the interview, but he was most probably a left-wing political opponent of the Nazis. He describes himself as a "simple prisoner," but one wonders, given his intelligence and strength of personality, what role he played in the prisoner underground dominated by the "reds."
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_17"></a>
            Given the system of prisoner "self administration," this was of the utmost importance in saving lives as Feuer's account subsequently illustrates.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_18"></a>
            Feuer might be referring here to the follow-up of an October 17, 1942 order by Himmler to transfer all Jewish prisoners in the Reich to Auschwitz. Obviously, he was among those Buchenwald Jewish prisoners who were spared deportation. It is unknown if this was due to any sort of standing he had among the "reds."
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_19"></a>
            This is an indication of the so-called "choiceless" choices often faced by the prisoners in the camps as well as the "grey zone" of morality, so well-described by Primo Levi, in which prisoners had to function. Often survival in the camps meant survival at someone else's expense. In those instances when life saving help could be given, a system of triage had to be employed.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_20"></a>
            For a detailed description of the struggle between the "greens" and the "reds" in Buchenwald and the consequences of its outcome, see Eugen Kogon's The Theory and Practice of Hell.

                <li>
            <a name="note_21"></a>
            Concentration camp prisoners often seethed with a desire for vengeance. However, the kind of retribution Feuer describes places him and others who sought to bring the perpetrators to trial in courts of law rather than killing them on the spot on a far higher moral and ethical plane than their oppressors. An American court tried twenty-one leading Buchenwald Nazis in 1947. Two were sentenced to death and four to life imprisonment.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_22"></a>
            The American forces did not have to shoot their way into Buchenwald. Before its liberation on April 11, 1945, the Germans had left, and the prisoner underground was in control of the facility. Unfortunately in the days before the liberation, thousands of prisoners had been shipped out of the camp, many of whom died from starvation, disease and exhaustion or were shot or beaten to death by the SS.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_23"></a>
            Buchenwald was not the main assembly point for all other concentration camps. What Feuer might be describing here is that in 1944-'45, owing to the advances of the Red army, thousands of prisoners including many Jews were transferred from camps in the East to Buchenwald. Some remained in the main camp, and others were sent to one of Buchenwald's many satellite camps such as Ohrdruf, which was visited by General Eisenhower and leading Congressional dignitaries.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_24"></a>
            The Nazis treated Russian prisoners of war horribly. They were considered subhuman and bearers of the "virus of Bolshevism." Most Soviet prisoners of war sent to Buchenwald were murdered soon after arrival.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_25"></a>
            Boder here means Freemasons, members of the international Masonic order that was considered by the Nazis to be an enemy of the Third Reich.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_26"></a>
            In fact there were a number of barbaric medical experiments that took place at Buchenwald using human beings. They were undertaken with the cooperation of the German armed services and various German firms such as I.G. Farben and the Behring works. SS doctors conducted tests with typhus, yellow fever, smallpox, cholera, diptheria, chemical warfare agents, phosphorus-rubber substances from incendiary bombs, poisoned ammunition, blood too old to be used on "normal patients" and other pathogens. Most subjects of these experiments died agonizing deaths. The most infamous of the experiments dealt with typhus in which hundreds infected with the disease perished. Since the method of the injection was later shown to be unscientific, the medical value of these tests was useless.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_27"></a>
            The question regarding the supposed lack of resistance on the part of the victims is asked again and again. It is answered by Elie Wiesel who wrote, "The question is not why there was not more resistance. The question is how so many found the strength to resist at all."
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_28"></a>
            Despite the horrendous conditions in the camp, the will to live that Feuer refers to should be understood as a form of resistance. Armed resistance, as he indicates, was suicidal, but prisoners could and did engage in moral, psychological and spiritual resistance.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_29"></a>
            As Mr. Feuer shows, not even the capos (the foremen of various camp work details) can be stereotyped.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_30"></a>
            Some capos used mimicry of SS methods while in the presence of their superiors in order to save lives.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_31"></a>
            The second of the two Nuremberg laws, the Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor, issued on September 15, 1935, prohibited marriages and extra marital intercourse between Jews and Germans. 
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_32"></a>
            Literally, "true prisoners." They had a higher status than the more recent arrivals due to the positions they occupied in the camp prisoner hierarchy and the increased chances for survival these positions could secure. It should be noted that the most prominent prisoners in Buchenwald were incarcerated in an isolated barrack deep in the woods. These celebrities included the former head the German Social Democratic party, Rudolf Breitscheid and his wife, the business magnate, Fritz Thyssen and the former French premier, Leon Blum.
        </li>

            Wetzlar is located in Hesse-Nassau Germany southeast of Marburg and north of Frankfurt.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_34"></a>
            These cowardly, self-serving responses infuriated Feuer. The German population around Buchenwald implausibly denied knowledge of its existence. But German civilians by the hundreds were brought by the American army to help clean the camp and dig mass graves.
        </li>
                <li>

            This is an example of the "paper walls" constructed by the U.S. State Department designed to curtail Jewish immigration. These "walls" doomed countless Jews seeking refuge.

                Concentration camp opened in 1936. Prisoners were employed in various branches of armament manufacture, especially airplane and tank engines. Some 200,000 prisoners passed through the camp. The exact number of those who perished is unknown.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.

            Responding to a move by the Polish government to deprive Polish Jews from the right of return from countries under German rule, the Germans drove some 17,000 Polish Jews into a no-man's-land between the two countries on October 28, 1938. The largest number were stranded near the border town of Zbaszyn.

            The exact fate of Herschel Grynszpan has not been determined. After the fall of France, the collaborationist Vichy government turned him over to the Germans.

            The incident related by Feuer regarding the murder of his friend by the SS man reflects the mentality of the SS and the defenselessness of the prisoners. The SS were conditioned to behave with utter ruthlessness and brutality to those who were the supposed enemies of the "master race." These so-called enemies could be killed or exploited to serve the greater "racial good." In the camps, the SS could act with impunity towards the prisoners, give vent to their sadistic passion and exercise to the utmost their "will to power." When the SS man spoke to Feuer after he had murdered his friend, he was not speaking to a fellow human being but rather to an animate object or thing.

            Feuer means "conscience." The SS were taught that pangs of conscience stemming from sympathy or compassion for their victims were signs of weakness that had to be stamped out.

            Buchenwald had some 130 satellite camps, the most infamous of which was Dora. The camps employed hundreds of thousands of slave laborers who were often worked to death for the German war effort.

            Construction on Buchenwald began in 1937 in a wooded area five miles from Weimar, the home of the noted German poet, Goethe, who supposedly rested and meditated under an oak tree, Goethe's oak. The oak was spared by the Nazis and designated the center of the camp, which was the antithesis of the humanistic and enlightened spirit of the poet and the democratic hopes on which the post World War I Weimar Republic was founded.

            Feuer most probably means Jehovah's Witnesses. The Witnesses would not swear an oath of allegiance to the state and as pacifists would not serve in the armed forces. They were persecuted and victimized by the Nazis. In the camps, they were identified by a purple triangle.

            The yellow triangle Feuer wore signified that he was a Jew. The red triangle signified that he was a also a political prisoner. Feuer did not reveal his political sympathies in the interview, but he was most probably a left-wing political opponent of the Nazis.

            Feuer might be referring here to the follow-up of an October 17, 1942 order by Himmler to transfer all Jewish prisoners in the Reich to Auschwitz. Obviously, he was among those Buchenwald Jewish prisoners who were spared deportation. It is unknown if this was due to any sort of standing he had among the "reds."

            This is an indication of the so-called "choiceless" choices often faced by the prisoners in the camps as well as the "grey zone" of morality, so well-described by Primo Levi, in which prisoners had to function. Often survival in the camps meant survival at someone else's expense. In those instances when life saving help could be given, a system of triage had to be employed.

            Concentration camp prisoners often seethed with a desire for vengeance. However, the kind of retribution Feuer describes places him and others who sought to bring the perpetrators to trial in courts of law rather than killing them on the spot on a far higher moral and ethical plane than their oppressors. An American court tried twenty-one leading Buchenwald Nazis in 1947. Two were sentenced to death and four to life imprisonment.

            The American forces did not have to shoot their way into Buchenwald. Before its liberation on April 11, 1945, the Germans had left, and the prisoner underground was in control of the facility. Unfortunately in the days before the liberation, thousands of prisoners had been shipped out of the camp, many of whom died from starvation, disease and exhaustion or were shot or beaten to death by the SS.

            Buchenwald was not the main assembly point for all other concentration camps. What Feuer might be describing here is that in 1944-'45, owing to the advances of the Red army, thousands of prisoners including many Jews were transferred from camps in the East to Buchenwald. Some remained in the main camp, and others were sent to one of Buchenwald's many satellite camps such as Ohrdruf, which was visited by General Eisenhower and leading Congressional dignitaries.

            In fact there were a number of barbaric medical experiments that took place at Buchenwald using human beings. They were undertaken with the cooperation of the German armed services and various German firms such as I.G. Farben and the Behring works. SS doctors conducted tests with typhus, yellow fever, smallpox, cholera, diptheria, chemical warfare agents, phosphorus-rubber substances from incendiary bombs, poisoned ammunition, blood too old to be used on "normal patients" and other pathogens. Most subjects of these experiments died agonizing deaths. The most infamous of the experiments dealt with typhus in which hundreds infected with the disease perished. Since the method of the injection was later shown to be unscientific, the medical value of these tests was useless.

            Literally, "true prisoners." They had a higher status than the more recent arrivals due to the positions they occupied in the camp prisoner hierarchy and the increased chances for survival these positions could secure. It should be noted that the most prominent prisoners in Buchenwald were incarcerated in an isolated barrack deep in the woods. These celebrities included the former head the German Social Democratic party, Rudolf Breitscheid and his wife, the business magnate, Fritz Thyssen and the former French premier, Leon Blum.
