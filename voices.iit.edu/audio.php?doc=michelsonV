Well, we shall try to see what we can get [recorded] in this short program, because we have changed our rule, and instead of letting everybody talk as long as possible, we are taking them in one half hour turns, because it simply would be a very great hardship to them of [my] not having listened to the representatives of each nationality.

I considered that to go to people who have started this war, and who according to their psychology, as previously, hate foreigners, that would mean to go into an environment known to be hostile. On the other hand, during this war, especially here, I had the opportunity to meet not only with Russians who had come from the East, but also with Poles, in part war prisoners who worked with farmers, in part . . . ehh . . . people taken out of there [Poland], and with Ukrainians, and most recently with Balts. And in all of them I noticed one common [character] streak, a streak of desire, after the war [pause], in some way to build, life on a new foundation, especially among the young people. On the basis of understanding each other, and friendship with each other . And it appeared to me that if this university, which is just now being created, would gain strength, if this university [pause] will come to be an entity which could really live and exist, then it could bring about a real collaboration of work with one with another, and especially for us, the people from the East who, as I observed for the last three years, could never come to terms to be friends with each other. They wanted it, but always continued thinking, &#39;No, I am a Ukrainian.&#39; &#39;I am a Pole. We can&#39;t be together,&#39; or &#39;I am a Ukrainian, and you are a Muscovite, a Russian.

[Pause] And already during the first month [pause] I, we, meaning, at the faculty started to talk thus: That in order to live actually in friendship, and in order to create academic conditions not akin to an average DP camp, which very many have experienced and which very many have left for the same reasons that I have left, we have to hold together and demand toward ourselves a different attitude, different than accorded to the average masses [of DP&#39;s], an attitude toward us as students, as studying youth."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2281.496","u": "Now what kind of a special attitude toward students at the university [are you talking about]?"},    {"who": "Valerius Michelson", "start": "2284.484","u": "This I can describe by means of an example which not long ago happened among us in a camp. I think that would interest you. We had here a strike, a very real hunger . . . hunger revolt, I would say. Ehh . . . That may appear strange. However, there were reasons for it. When the students once arrived in the morning at their university, they were not permitted to enter the university by the so-called DP police, that is, DP&#39;s who were organized to maintain order."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2324.580","u": "By DP you mean displaced persons? [The interviewer was apparently surprised that he used the English term.]"},    {"who": "Valerius Michelson", "start": "2328.021","u": " These DP . . . this DP police aroused the indignation of the students by their sheer appearance, because it is proper that there be no police in the university. But what was most strange was that they permitted themselves first to push and chase students from corner to corner, and when our professors arrived, after detaining the dean of the university, they submitted him to a meticulous . . . ehh . . . search, compelled him to present all kinds of documents, and treated him most impertinently. This aroused the students most of all. Afterwards quite a few professors of advanced age, in order to get into the university, had to jump over benches, among them a lady . . . ehh . . . , a microbiologist, most respected among us as a professor, was obliged to do the same and this was the reason that the students started a frightful noise and literally were beside themselves [Pause]. For me as the president of the student organization of our university it was very hard to quiet down the aroused students. After assembling them with great difficulty in the yard of the university, I asked the people to calm down, not to cause great debauchery, and if they want at all to do something . . . I agreed to the demand of the majority of the students to decide not to take any nourishment, not to eat, until we would be promised that the police will be removed and police method will not be used in our university. The strike lasted, all together, one day, only two times [meaning twice they staged a hunger strike] but it proved that during the six months which we had spent in the university all the students, without distinction of nationality or creed, had united into such a family that all went out on such a risky venture as a strike. There was complete solidarity. This is just an example, an example of that which we consider a wrong attitude towards students, and which arouses our indignation. That is precisely why we are talking about the academic spirit and relationships."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2460.972","u": "Now permit me. How did they explain it to you? How did that whole police episode come about?"},    {"who": "Valerius Michelson", "start": "2466.314","u": "It had come about by mistake. By a big mistake . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2468.185","u": "But since it was a mistake [?] . . ."},    {"who": "Valerius Michelson", "start": "2469.483","u": "Entirely correct. But it seems to me that concerning students such mistakes are not permissible, [as if correcting himself] and in general concerning people, not only students. After all, there exist different norms of conduct . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2479.413","u": "Well, yes, but here is a theater of military operations . . ."},    {"who": "Valerius Michelson", "start": "2482.310","u": "That is correct. But in spite of that I don&#39;t think that we have given any grounds for such treatment. We endeavor [unintelligible] always to behave correctly, and [pause] I personally consider that the strike was a very bad thing. I . . . personally do not like it, because it is not proper to do such things."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2500.419","u": "What was improper?"},    {"who": "Valerius Michelson", "start": "2501.234","u": "It was improper to organize a strike, et cetera. I think it would have been possible to come to terms without it. But it was provoked, because that was not the first time, and that is why it occurred, due to the mood."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2512.190","u": "You see, I think we have to give here some explanation. Deutsches Museum is not only a university. You have here also a center for the registration of DP&#39;s."},    {"who": "Valerius Michelson", "start": "2523.266","u": "Entirely correct."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2523.870","u": "And it is possible, when the police was posted, they . . . [apparently coughs] police were posted, they were not exactly told which points . . . ehh . . . to say, to guard and which to open."},    {"who": "Valerius Michelson", "start": "2535.339","u": "Unfortunately this did not take place. The fact of the matter is that there are entrances from two sides. At one side the DPs enter, and this was directed definitely against the students, because on that day . . . ehh . . . there was a check-up on the attendance of the lectures, which the student body exercises on its own, on its own initiative, since we don&#39;t want to have idlers in our university, or people who would come to the university solely to take advantage of the privileges given by UNRRA, and for which we are very grateful to UNRRA, but only . . . ehh . . . [people who would come] to study. And people who study we want in our university. And that is why we maintained through our student organization such registrations, and we were able to furnish information about who the people were, et cetera."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2576.443","u": "Well, [pause] is there anything else that you would like to tell us or you would like to tell the American students?"},    {"who": "Valerius Michelson", "start": "2583.355","u": "To the American students I should like to say this, that the students, the foreigners who study in our university and who in a very large part study in German universities, all of them endeavor to rally together, endeavor to overcome all the hatred among nations, which is still up to now very strong in Europe, in order to work towards the construction of their countries in the spirit of cooperation [friendship] with the rest, in the spirit of actual all-human friendship, so that there be no more events like the past war, that here would be no more events similar to Hitler&#226;s state. And we want the creation of an international university. We know that what we have here now in Munich is not an international university. Or better, it is international, but not yet a university, because we are short of very many things. Even we ourselves, in our own views about the world, [and] in our . . . ehh . . . opportunities, needed to call ourselves a real international university. But we think that we could serve as a kernel for such a cooperation, and for such a university in which would be brought up the intelligentsia of the future. That is about all."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2660.025","u": "So. [In English] This concludes the interview of Mr. Valerius Michelson, a student of architecture at the International University of UNRRA. Munich, September the 24th, 1946. We had here quite some interruptions of some very important visitors which [whom] I could not stave away, and from that standpoint we have lost at times quite a bit some time [of material].

What were they thinking about? They did not think of taking back what was taken from them by force. What they thought about was that in Soviet Russia they had no chance to steal, they had no opportunity to rob people, to kill. Here they literally organized in gangs in order to promote their own [selfish] business, and not for the purpose of having avenged the evil which the Germans had done to them.

I considered that to go to people who have started this war, and who according to their psychology, as previously, hate foreigners, that would mean to go into an environment known to be hostile. On the other hand, during this war, especially here, I had the opportunity to meet not only with Russians who had come from the East, but also with Poles, in part war prisoners who worked with farmers, in part . . . ehh . . . people taken out of there [Poland], and with Ukrainians, and most recently with Balts. And in all of them I noticed one common [character] streak, a streak of desire, after the war [pause], in some way to build, life on a new foundation, especially among the young people. On the basis of understanding each other, and friendship with each other . And it appeared to me that if this university, which is just now being created, would gain strength, if this university [pause] will come to be an entity which could really live and exist, then it could bring about a real collaboration of work with one with another, and especially for us, the people from the East who, as I observed for the last three years, could never come to terms to be friends with each other. They wanted it, but always continued thinking, &#39;No, I am a Ukrainian.&#39; &#39;I am a Pole. We can&#39;t be together,&#39; or &#39;I am a Ukrainian, and you are a Muscovite, a Russian. You . . . ehh . . . are oppressing our nation,&#39; et cetera. And it appeared to me that in this university we, the youth, who after [pause] sufficient preparation will become the leaders in their own countries, in their own lands . . . if we should be friends among ourselves we would be able to create a rapprochement between our countries to an extent necessary in order that there will be neither wars nor these horrible totalitarian regimes which humiliate man and [oppress] his abilities to think and to create for the good of other [his fellow] men. And with this idea I came to the university. The first thing that I noticed at the university [pause] was that there was no such idea, that people have come here after the long years, during which they were torn away from learning, in order to study. That was good. But [pause] that was not all. What was missing here was unity, and for that reason the scholastic, academic spirit was also missing. [Pause] And already during the first month [pause] I, we, meaning, at the faculty started to talk thus: That in order to live actually in friendship, and in order to create academic conditions not akin to an average DP camp, which very many have experienced and which very many have left for the same reasons that I have left, we have to hold together and demand toward ourselves a different attitude, different than accorded to the average masses [of DP&#39;s], an attitude toward us as students, as studying youth.</p>

                    <p class="utterance"> These DP . . . this DP police aroused the indignation of the students by their sheer appearance, because it is proper that there be no police in the university. But what was most strange was that they permitted themselves first to push and chase students from corner to corner, and when our professors arrived, after detaining the dean of the university, they submitted him to a meticulous . . . ehh . . . search, compelled him to present all kinds of documents, and treated him most impertinently. This aroused the students most of all. Afterwards quite a few professors of advanced age, in order to get into the university, had to jump over benches, among them a lady . . . ehh . . . , a microbiologist, most respected among us as a professor, was obliged to do the same and this was the reason that the students started a frightful noise and literally were beside themselves [Pause]. For me as the president of the student organization of our university it was very hard to quiet down the aroused students. After assembling them with great difficulty in the yard of the university, I asked the people to calm down, not to cause great debauchery, and if they want at all to do something . . . I agreed to the demand of the majority of the students to decide not to take any nourishment, not to eat, until we would be promised that the police will be removed and police method will not be used in our university. The strike lasted, all together, one day, only two times [meaning twice they staged a hunger strike] but it proved that during the six months which we had spent in the university all the students, without distinction of nationality or creed, had united into such a family that all went out on such a risky venture as a strike. There was complete solidarity. This is just an example, an example of that which we consider a wrong attitude towards students, and which arouses our indignation. That is precisely why we are talking about the academic spirit and relationships.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">Entirely correct. But it seems to me that concerning students such mistakes are not permissible, [as if correcting himself] and in general concerning people, not only students. After all, there exist different norms of conduct . . .</p>

                    <p class="utterance">That is correct. But in spite of that I don&#39;t think that we have given any grounds for such treatment.

                    <p class="utterance">Unfortunately this did not take place. The fact of the matter is that there are entrances from two sides. At one side the DPs enter, and this was directed definitely against the students, because on that day . . . ehh . . . there was a check-up on the attendance of the lectures, which the student body exercises on its own, on its own initiative, since we don&#39;t want to have idlers in our university, or people who would come to the university solely to take advantage of the privileges given by UNRRA, and for which we are very grateful to UNRRA, but only . . . ehh . . . [people who would come] to study. And people who study we want in our university. And that is why we maintained through our student organization such registrations, and we were able to furnish information about who the people were, et cetera.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">To the American students I should like to say this, that the students, the foreigners who study in our university and who in a very large part study in German universities, all of them endeavor to rally together, endeavor to overcome all the hatred among nations, which is still up to now very strong in Europe, in order to work towards the construction of their countries in the spirit of cooperation [friendship] with the rest, in the spirit of actual all-human friendship, so that there be no more events like the past war, that here would be no more events similar to Hitler&#226;s state. And we want the creation of an international university. We know that what we have here now in Munich is not an international university. Or better, it is international, but not yet a university, because we are short of very many things. Even we ourselves, in our own views about the world, [and] in our . . . ehh . . . opportunities, needed to call ourselves a real international university. But we think that we could serve as a kernel for such a cooperation, and for such a university in which would be brought up the intelligentsia of the future. That is about all.</p>
