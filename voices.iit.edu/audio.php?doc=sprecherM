A few days before our arrest in Berlin, we have heard already about the actions against the Polish Jews in the various cities of the Germans provinces, Leipzig, Frankfurt.

And in that they would recognize exactly that one or the other was moving. So he would mark down through the window from the outside which number, or which place was occupied by the prisoner who was moving, and he would come in and administer the punishment prescribed for it by the block-elder. The punishment consisted in calling the prisoner to the front, to the first row, and the block-elder, the room-elder, block-fuehrer in the uniform of the SS alternately belabored the poor prisoner with pieces of wood, pieces of iron until the man would break down.

It was fortunate for a Jew if he had a chance to die soon. But there were a lot of &#39;falling&#39; people who suffered a day or two until they died. In order that these people could get a little bit more air, we usually placed them near the door, because through the cracks in the door these gravely ill people could get a little bit more air."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "972.928","u": "Nu."},    {"who": "Max Sprecher", "start": "973.328","u": "The pleasure of the SS and the block-elders consisted in coming in intervals from hour, and to make with us punitive sports in these overheated barracks."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "987.269","u": "What does it mean in intervals from hour to hour?

Thus the air there was very bad. It was impossible to breathe. So it was very difficult for the block leaders, for the SS, to spend all day together with us in this heavy fowl air. So they stayed ordinarily outside. So they would come in from time to time during [?] the day, and made with us strenuous punitive sports. But as soon as they had spent with us a few minutes, it became hard for them to breathe in this heavy air, so they stopped, went out, and in an hour or two [then] the whole drill was &#39;pigged&#39; over again [the whole procedure would start all over again]."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1036.743","u": "So you were rolling indoors, inside . . ."},    {"who": "Max Sprecher", "start": "1039.460","u": "In the block, two . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1040.823","u": "But there was no room."},    {"who": "Max Sprecher", "start": "1042.517","u": "That was . . . that was the purpose of rolling, it was ordered that we were to roll in twos, in threes, that is one lies [corrects himself] rolls underneath on the ground, the second rolls over him, and the third rolls over the second. You can imagine that in this heavy air, and with these run-down people, they nearly crushed each other in the [process of rolling. There was no other way, because the block-elders together with the SS were compelling the unconscious people, unconscious from suffering, unconscious from the sticking air, and unconscious from the hard &#39;sport&#39;, which these exhausted [?] people were unable to stand. Now there is one thing about it. I have stated that we were placing first of all our sick, our gravely sick peoples near the door, so these people may have still a bit of air in their last hours of life. This by and by was noticed by the SS and the block-elders from outside, and they compelled [us] . . . so when they came in, they soon gave a command to roll, with the intent that we should roll above these gravely sick people, who were in part in coma [?] and so lead them into death. In the first [starting] row were lying a row of very young and well &#39;sportly&#39; developed [physically strong] people. As soon as we heard the slightest motion in the vestibule, we instantly jumped back a half a meter. So when the command would come: &#39;roll&#39;, we would roll, but not over the sick but only one over the other, over those who were well. The aim of the SS [which] was that we ourselves should murder with our own bodies our gravely ill [?] brothers, did not materialize."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1160.081","u": "Now, continue. What happened to you afterwards?"},    {"who": "Max Sprecher", "start": "1162.798","u": "The other punishments, one could think it a light punishment, were [for instance] to lie simply on the stomach. The first day it was still tolerable. The second day many arose . . . many of us arose with torn skin and with blood on the chest. It is not as easy to bear for a few hours . . . to bear tightly pressed one against the other, from various . . . through the various pressures from people who were lying in front, behind and on the sides. The pressure, and the wounds were so acute, that after the first or second day we all had bleeding wounds. The hand was torn and it was bleeding like from a water main. At that there also occurred cases when particularly privileged [?] SS were looking for some special enjoyments. I shall describe one of them. There entered six inebriated SS. They had in their hands various pieces of wood, pieces of iron, and thick pieces of rubber hose. The title of the play was called that day &#39;blood bath.&#39; A &#39;blood bath&#39; consisted in the following: We had to line up in one row. Each SS man was given a row which he was to &#39;belabor&#39;. And he was beating over the face, over the eyes, over the nose, over the mouth until blood started flowing. When blood begins to flow a human grabs instinctively with his hand the bleeding wound, as if to stop the bleeding. In that moment would come the command: stand still. We were prohibited to move our hands, and the blood was flowing down to the ground. And in front of every person was formed a little puddle of blood. And so, since we were standing still, due to this standing the blood too stood still. So there came the command: &#39;motion&#39;, or, &#39;lie down.&#39; Through the motion, and lying down with an open wound, the blood gushed, flowed again.

His interest in the run of the camp was satisfied for a while with it. And so, there was no interest on the part of the SS, of the lager management, to ascertain how our block looks from the inside.

The details are standing in groups. At the head of each detail stands a capo [trusty] who leads his detail through the gate. At the gate sits the Jewish orchestra and plays. That was so ordered, established a few years back in the concentration camps in Austria, in Germany proper. Subsequently it was taken over by the concentration camps in the East at the borders between Germany and Poland, in Silesia, and, for example, in Auschwitz and the many sub-lagers near Auschwitz. All at once there came an order that the labor details which were about to leave the lager should step back. Each one back to his block. The reason was that a very large transport of Jewish prisoners [synonymous repetion] of Jewish prisoners had arrived from Hungary [Footnote: The deportation of the Jews from Hungary represents a special chaper, and is allegedly interwoven with the tragic fate of the Gypsies. There are also substantial repercussions at present (Summer 1955) in Israel connected with the Hungarian deportations. &#226;D.P.B.] Since the transport was very large, they had to be led simultaneously to all five crematories. There arrived a hundred RR-cars, and each was packed with a hundred to a hundred and twenty prisoners. And so the whole road was a mass of moving, newly arrived Jews from Hungary, and [so] we had no room to get through to our work. Only after the Jewish prisoners from Hungary were led through on the way to the crematory were able to pass to work. And while these Jewish prisoners from Hungary marched to the crematory there was sitting in every lager a prisoners&#39; orchestra and played &#226; played the tunes which the SS had selected. Many cheerful Viennese tunes, other tunes, at the wish of the SS were played while the Jews were approaching step by step each one to his creamtory. [Pause]. There was a case. I was going one morning to the crematory two. Crematory one and two. There it was arranged that the gas chambers were underground. The crematories three and four were set so that the gas chambers were above ground.

We have arrived here last night, together with our parents and we have lost them. We slept the night here below in the ditch. I knew where the parents were, but I could not reply to the children. Moreover, I was unable to give the children an answer, because at that instant there approaced us from the other side one of the SS men who were working in the lager. In passing at a distance he heard the question which the children have asked me. I went on, as if I have heard nothing, as if they have not spoken to me. He went over to the children and spoke to them: &#39;Come children, I take you to your father.&#39; He took them to crematory one.

So we knew exactly with what kind of tools we would have to work and if our tools could be used for that purpose. Besides we prepared a number of various acts, which consisted of the following. We organized groups to escape from the lager and we supplied them with books from the crematory with names in the hope that if not all, so a part will get through, and the names of the fallen people will get out and remain in existence for the world. We also made attempts to make contact with the [a long pause; it seems that at times the revival of memories was so realistic that even a year after liberation people were hesistant to talk about &#39;illegal&#39; acts perpetrated in the camps against the Nazis] . . . with the partisans who were active there in that region. We did not succeed in it completely. The contact was made at a time when the partisans started &#39;working&#39; . . . executing their underground [?] work in the environs of our lager. There came on the 18th of January &#39;45 the evacuation of the lager. What we have accomplished was that a part of the prisoners, Poles [Christians], sympathizers of radical leftist movements, who had escaped from the lager have joined in a short time the partisan movement of the region, have attacked the lager in Bodi [?], and during the shooting fell two former prisoners of the lager                     Auschwitz.

Through a contact with a few Jewish girls who formed a transport detail, who would bring explosives [?] from the factory especially during the night shift, since then the people were not as precisely controlled. And so a rather large amount [of grenades, explosives] was accumulated in the hands of the &#39;special commando&#39;, which had worked there. When the time of transport [evacuation] came for the special commando, they refused to join the transport because two groups of the transport details to whome it was promised that they will be taken to other places to work, were shipped to the famous [?] gas chamber in Auschwitz and there they were gas-killed. Since they knew what was threatening them, they took their grenades, in their hands, and fighting, four hundred Jews fell with arms in their hands, members of the special commando in Auschwitz. I in part assisted in this thing [project] which was for all of us a satisfaction [to know] that if we shall have to die, we will know that as far as it was possible for us, we have obstructed the work of extermination which they perpetrated on us in the lager. In addition a substantial part of the work consisted in sabotage of the work, of the productive work which we had . . . had to do, be it construction work, be it . . . destruction and breaking of valuable tools . . . and that is how we endeavored through the work of sabotage [he becomes oratorical and fails to find the proper words] a part of the satisfaction . . . a part of the meaning [purpose] for us and the sake of other people."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "3917.966","u": "Now then go ahead.

So they would come in from time to time during [?] the day, and made with us strenuous punitive sports. But as soon as they had spent with us a few minutes, it became hard for them to breathe in this heavy air, so they stopped, went out, and in an hour or two [then] the whole drill was &#39;pigged&#39; over again [the whole procedure would start all over again].</p>

You can imagine that in this heavy air, and with these run-down people, they nearly crushed each other in the [process of rolling. There was no other way, because the block-elders together with the SS were compelling the unconscious people, unconscious from suffering, unconscious from the sticking air, and unconscious from the hard &#39;sport&#39;, which these exhausted [?] people were unable to stand. Now there is one thing about it. I have stated that we were placing first of all our sick, our gravely sick peoples near the door, so these people may have still a bit of air in their last hours of life. This by and by was noticed by the SS and the block-elders from outside, and they compelled [us] . . . so when they came in, they soon gave a command to roll, with the intent that we should roll above these gravely sick people, who were in part in coma [?] and so lead them into death. In the first [starting] row were lying a row of very young and well &#39;sportly&#39; developed [physically strong] people. As soon as we heard the slightest motion in the vestibule, we instantly jumped back a half a meter. So when the command would come: &#39;roll&#39;, we would roll, but not over the sick but only one over the other, over those who were well. The aim of the SS [which] was that we ourselves should murder with our own bodies our gravely ill [?] brothers, did not materialize.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">The other punishments, one could think it a light punishment, were [for instance] to lie simply on the stomach. The first day it was still tolerable. The second day many arose . . . many of us arose with torn skin and with blood on the chest. It is not as easy to bear for a few hours . . . to bear tightly pressed one against the other, from various . . . through the various pressures from people who were lying in front, behind and on the sides. The pressure, and the wounds were so acute, that after the first or second day we all had bleeding wounds. The hand was torn and it was bleeding like from a water main. At that there also occurred cases when particularly privileged [?] SS were looking for some special enjoyments. I shall describe one of them. There entered six inebriated SS. They had in their hands various pieces of wood, pieces of iron, and thick pieces of rubber hose. The title of the play was called that day &#39;blood bath.&#39; A &#39;blood bath&#39; consisted in the following: We had to line up in one row. Each SS man was given a row which he was to &#39;belabor&#39;. And he was beating over the face, over the eyes, over the nose, over the mouth until blood started flowing. When blood begins to flow a human grabs instinctively with his hand the bleeding wound, as if to stop the bleeding. In that moment would come the command: stand still. We were prohibited to move our hands, and the blood was flowing down to the ground. And in front of every person was formed a little puddle of blood. And so, since we were standing still, due to this standing the blood too stood still. So there came the command: &#39;motion&#39;, or, &#39;lie down.&#39; Through the motion, and lying down with an open wound, the blood gushed, flowed again. When there was enough blood for each row, there came the command to lie down and to &#39;roll&#39; in it with the face. Then we had to get up and all our faces were red from the blood. The SS was satisfied and the program for that day was completed. [Pause].</p>

He was a tall, strong, and very healthy person. He was conspicuous as to height and good appearance. And from the first day the SS started to molest him. Also the block-elder.

On the eighth day he had not a single healthy spot, not a single healthy centimeter on his body. It was all covered and swollen with blood. I still remember the last night. This pious person recited on the top of his voice the Vida [the prayer for those about to die] and the whole block, whether young or old, joined in the weeping and chanting. In the middle of the night the man had the fortune to die. He fell in a very deep stupor, and in the stupor he tore off all his clothes. And in the morning when we sat up he was lying dead, naked, and around him, like, just like during all the last days, was the blood-[soaked] red straw mattress [paillasse]. During the last few days we were laying that man, since the man had numerous open wounds, on the same straw mattress. On the same day it happened that just by accident the lager fuehrer passed through [the block]. He never used to take an interest in our block, because his interest was limited to the daily report on the conditions and to the mortality report. The first greeting which was dealt out to us the first days in the lager, when we were aroused at three, three thirty in the morning was: &#39;How many dead are there today?&#39; Not a &#39;Good morning&#39;, not a, &#39;Get up&#39;, only &#39;How many dead are there today?&#39; And everyone who would ascertain that his neighbor was cold, reported: &#39;Here is one; here is one more.&#39; And so he would compose his memo [?], his death-report, and with it he would run to the office. His interest in the run of the camp was satisfied for a while with it. And so, there was no interest on the part of the SS, of the lager management, to ascertain how our block looks from the inside.

I just want to recall a little episode which reveals our mood while we were traveling to Auschwitz. The same day our things were taken away from us. Even in a lager one may have a relationship to his own things [an &#39;attitude&#39; towards one&#39;s own things], even to prisoners&#39; things. There were things that gave a certain [amount of warmth]. It was already autumn and warm things were of importance. [Same whisper] In the preparations for the transport, our warm things were taken away and we were given light summer things. This way the prisoners were usually dressed, when they were led to the &#39;industrial&#39; yard, near the lager                     Sachsenhausen to be shot. And [therefore] we all were sure that we are not lead to transport but that we shall be shot at night in the large square at the &#39;industrial&#39; yard of the lager . . . of the concentration camp Sachsenhausen.</p>

The transport consisted then only of Jewish prisoners, because, as I mentioned, it was decided at that time to send all the Jewish prisoners to the concentration camps pertaining to Auschwitz.

Buna was called Auschwitz II [two], a small lager annex, near Auswitz. It was small in terms of a lager for prisoners, but it was to be built up into the largest industrial project of the I.G.

At the head of each detail stands a capo [trusty] who leads his detail through the gate. At the gate sits the Jewish orchestra and plays. That was so ordered, established a few years back in the concentration camps in Austria, in Germany proper. Subsequently it was taken over by the concentration camps in the East at the borders between Germany and Poland, in Silesia, and, for example, in Auschwitz and the many sub-lagers near Auschwitz. All at once there came an order that the labor details which were about to leave the lager should step back. Each one back to his block. The reason was that a very large transport of Jewish prisoners [synonymous repetion] of Jewish prisoners had arrived from Hungary [Footnote: The deportation of the Jews from Hungary represents a special chaper, and is allegedly interwoven with the tragic fate of the Gypsies. There are also substantial repercussions at present (Summer 1955) in Israel connected with the Hungarian deportations. &#226;D.P.B.] Since the transport was very large, they had to be led simultaneously to all five crematories. There arrived a hundred RR-cars, and each was packed with a hundred to a hundred and twenty prisoners. And so the whole road was a mass of moving, newly arrived Jews from Hungary, and [so] we had no room to get through to our work. Only after the Jewish prisoners from Hungary were led through on the way to the crematory were able to pass to work. And while these Jewish prisoners from Hungary marched to the crematory there was sitting in every lager a prisoners&#39; orchestra and played &#226; played the tunes which the SS had selected. Many cheerful Viennese tunes, other tunes, at the wish of the SS were played while the Jews were approaching step by step each one to his creamtory. [Pause]. There was a case. I was going one morning to the crematory two. Crematory one and two. There it was arranged that the gas chambers were underground. The crematories three and four were set so that the gas chambers were above ground. In both, in the four crematories were working hundreds of Jewish prisoners.</p>

We have arrived here last night, together with our parents and we have lost them. We slept the night here below in the ditch. I knew where the parents were, but I could not reply to the children. Moreover, I was unable to give the children an answer, because at that instant there approaced us from the other side one of the SS men who were working in the lager. In passing at a distance he heard the question which the children have asked me. I went on, as if I have heard nothing, as if they have not spoken to me. He went over to the children and spoke to them: &#39;Come children, I take you to your father.&#39; He took them to crematory one.
