From there I was taken with many thousand prisoners of war to <a class="placename" href="#vothL196">Kutno</a>, and they held us in a small building, five thousand prisoners of war crowded in. Without water, without the least sanitary requirements. Bread we got—hundred fifty gram [about 5 oz.] a day. We were given a bit of bran, and without water, without salt. That was the treatment [the fair]. [Footnote 1: He endeavors to speak German, or possibly his Yiddish has become altered due to prolonged contact with Germans.

En route—we were "discharged" in <a class="placename" href="#vothL92">Lublin</a>. There they took off literally everything from all the military prisoners. The boots which I had because I belonged to the artillery were pulled off my feet. The overcoat, the coat, nothing was left but the pants and underpants, so they left me stand. Without a shirt. Winter. That was the second of March, 1940. There the custody was taken over by the Wehrmacht, <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a>, which was assembled from among the youth of Polish hoodlums and skum. There were youths of sixteen, seventeen years [of age], who did not know how to load the arms, but they knew how to shoot. And many were in that way murdered by them. There the conditions were exceptionally bad. Each day appeared like a year. After spending eight days in this <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, I arrived home. At home I still found everybody alive. But every Jew was already wearing the all-known Jew-star. There were already streets on which Jews were not permitted to walk.</span>

On an early morning at four o'clock, at daybreak, on a Wednesday, the whole town was aroused from sleep and put on its feet. And all men without distinction, Jews, from sixteen to fifty years of age, were taken out to various squares. They were taken out by the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a>. A few thousand <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a>.man arrived, in a town which had a population of only about fifteen thousand, and they started punitive expedition.</span>

Because today, when everyone of us, and I, for example as well, when I should consider all that I have gone through, because it is impossible to tell about it in one hour, in two hours, in a week, it is impossible . . . , all the details I have experienced. But if today it would have come about to experience for one month, what I experienced during years, I should definitely not go through with it.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
