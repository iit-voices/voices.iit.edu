Now you have to make it clear to yourself, that they have not only told you the truth but that they are not able to relate everything the way how it really was. Because if you look back to history, or if one writes a book about something, so it is usually said that one writes always more than is true. But in this case it is entirely in the reverse.

Sure enough they couldn't all at once shoot all the Jews, but they have arranged it this way. Since they did everything in a systematic fashion, so that nobody should notice it, and that nobody should be able to escape. So as soon as the Germans came in, they set a special hour when we could go out, and otherwise we could not go out.</span>

If one was very much afraid, and he could not hide the things, so he surrendered them. But if one was more adventurous and wanted to take chances, then he hid it. And on that depended the life of people. Because if one had no money one could die from starvation. The worst thing that happened at the beginning was . . . we got bread coupons, and everything was rationed, but for us it was a question of bread, because other things one could still get. But if one had the bread coupons it still was not easy to get bread. We couldn't simply go to a store or a bakery and say, "Here are the coupons and give me the bread". One would stand from ten o'clock in the evening until six o'clock in the morning, whether it was cold or hot, whether it rained until one would reach the window to get the bread.

Often it was that the Poles would recognize the Jews, they knew them still before the war, and since they wanted more bread they would tell to the Germans, "yes, this is a Jew", and with a finger they would point at the Jew. It was the only word they learned to say in German. They would say, and in that way they would betray a Jew who had been standing for twelve hours in line and when he at last got to the window, "Jew out of here, go away". And under such conditions we lived right from the start, when the Germans came in. And still it was from the beginning in Poland that there were a lot of Jews so they arranged that concessions were given to Jewish bakers and they baked the bread for the Jews. In this respect it became a little bit easier, so that one was standing only among Jews. At least when one got to the window the words "Jew go away",wasn't heard anymore because all were Jews in the line. That was only the beginning what the Germans have done when they come in. But it went on and on. They evicted the Jews from various streets and even prohibited any Jew to appear on such a street. And so it went on and on and we were more and more driven together. Into one section where the Jews lived, and now an order came and it was necessary to clean the streets. So who was being taken. Of course, the Jew.</span>

And with this work they did the same thing. They wrote to the Jewish Community Council that on such and such a day or every day so and so many workers have to be presented.

That would be all right, 250 grams of bread would be enough, but if one gets only bread, if one can't get potatoes or corn flour, and no fat; can one live on 250 grams daily? People had to support each other and help out each other. It is just impossible to be starving. When a person is hungry he is ready to do anything. So what could he do? One looked for somebody who would bring in bread on the black or flour and one paid more, and in order to pay more one needs money and so 1 mark 75 wasn't enough.</span>

One would do business on the black, others would work over time, people would simply risk their lives somehow to get through, and those who could not do it, who did not have enough courage or were too much afraid, these had to starve. And so many went caput, died right before me. One may, so to speak, say as the first winter passed, the worst was not . . . I mean when I just look back, I think that during the first winter the cruelty of the Germans was not yet recognized. People as I said . . . a family, we were still sitting together. Sometimes we played cards. We still laughed. It wasn't yet so noticeable. People had still some money from before the war and so people could manage somehow.</span>

Because it is a thing that one can hide, and in the beginnings things were not so strict that they would come and search each and every house. It was a small thing. They didn't say that the money had to be given up because they needed it, because they could have as much money as they wanted. They made [printed] it themselves, but it was simply done to oppress the Jews with the surrendering of the money it wasn't so bad at first. The purpose wasn't to take away the money, it was to destroy us all. The first winter of the war, with great pains, sometimes we ate, sometimes we didn't eat, but we pulled through. But in the summer there began the bombardment of the German cities, and many Germans wanted to enrich themselves in spite of that because they could take away the property of the Jews and so they came to Poland from different corners of Germany they came. The first time it was so that they were put in Jewish businesses as custodians. They managed the business and at the beginning the firm remained under the old name. Of course it isn't important what the name of the firm is, but who gets the money from it. That were the Germans. On the one side it was good because to some extent they left the businesses in the hands of the Jews, and man . . .</span>

One thinks that it ought to be that way. As it is being said, old proverbs are true. In most cases I found that they are true and that they always have their application. And so here we adapted ourselves. The first raid made on us a terrible impression, but pretty soon there was another razzia. They have taken this one, they have taken the other one. It becomes like the daily bread. When one would go to bed he would say, well, tomorrow it will be this way or that way. Every day somebody would come and would tell, I have heard that tomorrow there will be again a razzia. They would come here one week or the other. And so it stopped making any impression on us. It was told just like fairy tale. Just like a story. These things were told and were talked about. Without anybody making a sour or horrified face. It began to appear very simple. With us, as I told you that through the business trustees the Germans and the Jews began to have, to gain some mutual confidence. It came to be that some people had favor in their eyes. These people became privileged. So for a sum of money they could save a Jew so that he should not go to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> [camp]. And so there were occurring scenes quite often that one knew that you go to such and such a person and you give him such and such a sum of money till it has become practically [a matter of] a fixed fee for these things. A fixed prize.</span>

Merchandise went up higher and higher and the mark went down. And the 10,000 mark wasn't much at the time. Just a kind of an idea, a notion, just a notion of having 10,000 marks. It wasn't really very much. Just because everything was being sold some people felt themselves very rich because they had tens of thousands of marks. At that time they talked and said to themselves that if they already have the money, they are safe, because no person could ever imagine, nobody could ever think that it would come to that, that either money or a human being, any agreement will lose its value. That simply all Jews will be annihilated, that nobody could imagine then. People were thinking "they may take my enemies, they will take that many, well, just a certain number," but soon people noticed that that was indeed a systematic procedure.</span>

Finally the German police thought things over, thought why do they have to get up at night, and take people to the police station to feed them there. They created a Jewish militia, that is the Jewish Council who had their say over the Jewish community, had an organization and they themselves had to run everything. This militia had, first of all, to keep order on the streets. And its first duty was to serve the Jewish Cultural Commonwealth. [By the Cultural Commonwealth is really meant the Jewish executive committee]. They had authority over everything, because in such times people move around a great deal and when somebody does something it is said that he is a bad man. They would not put themselves in his place to understand whether he really wanted to do it that way, whether he has done that on purpose. They simply say, and it isn't unusual, people say that people are dissatisfied when wrong is being done to them . . . some people go and complain. And so they have created a Jewish police, a Jewish militia to keep order. Furthermore, they needed the Jewish militia. It had to keep over that was so difficult to do. They took over now the razzias. Razzias were now done by the Jewish militia. They would get an order that so and so many Jews had to be delivered to go to a working camp or to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>, there was already an <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a> and we had heard about <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. So they would give an order to the Community Council and instruct them to make out a list so they themselves should settle everything. They would dispatch everything. Now when a razzia had to take place they would get the police from central Community Council in <a class="placename" href="#vothL98">Sosnowice</a> and would expedite everything. It was arranged so that when they would arrest a man, a Jewish militioner would lead him undeer the arm, and an extra police cordon would surround the locality to keep watch. This cordon was put up so there would be no disturbance. Well, the influence of the militia people . . .</span>

He was not an intelligent person. [In this case intelligence means highly educated]. Possibly he had some education. His character was not so good. That became later evident from his deeds, and all that what this man had on his conscience what he could bear with at least in the beginning is proof that he did not belong to the noble souls. To his best friends he gave good jobs. Good positions. And these friends had again friends, relatives and so on. They had pull. These people had penetrated into the Community council, they worked there. And they fared well. Because from all the supplies that were allotted to the Jews they still could live [well]. Because if there comes an allotment for 5,000 people, say food, you still can one take off from each a little bit and then one has it in super-abundance, or much too much. And so the Jewish Community Council existed. They really did not have to take away from everyone too much in order to live a very good life. A very abundant life. With the Jewish militia it was the same thing. When there were already Jewish functionaries in the Jewish community council they got in there friends and these looked around in turn and they named them [their friends] as candidates. They were inspected, looked on, whether they were strong enough, whether he is of good health. First of all whether he will not feel embarrassed to drag a Jew across the streets to take him to prison‚Äîbecause there was a Jewish prison, and when he has to club a Jew, he would also not be embarrassed to do it.

As a whole he still could exist. He was still receiving his salary. At the beginning he did not suffer from the war in the same measure as the whole population did, the Jewish population. And so with the organization of the Jewish militia it became much worse than before. It became especially bad for those who had no acquaintances among the militia and that was nearly the whole population, because a militia man did not mistreat his own family, he always tried to protect them somehow. Always to forewarn them, at least as much as was in his power. But the general Jewish population suffered much more [on account of the Jewish militia].</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="kimmelmannA" start="2264.214" end="x">A German policeman, if he would be given the address of a Jew, if he would go there for the first time, he wouldn't know the man. He didn't know where he could hide and so on. He, the German, when he gets an order, he fulfills it. He goes there, if he doesn't find anybody, he comes back, files his report, and the issue is closed. A Jewish militiaman when he would get an order, well, he would watch the Jew, he knew him, he was acquainted with him, he knew him yet from before the war, he knew where he was or where he could hide, of course he would sooner be able to find him than a German, and so they were much worse. Under these conditions, a revolutionary spirit developed in each person stronger than ever before. Because if one says, a German has beaten me, I know the Germans. The Germans, well I can't expect anything from them. I can expect from them as much as I can expect from the whole world. It's the same thing like one lives his family, also one has his friends, also people who one knows from a distance. If one asks anything from those people and they don't grant it one can say, "Well, they are bad people," or they may understand him and say, "He possibly is unable to do it," and they say, "He is just a mean person, he wouldn't grant me this favor." On the other hand, if I request anything from a sister or my mother or any of my relatives, and he does not grant it to me, then I am greatly grieved, and I feel that I have a right to reproach him. And well, just the same thing happened with us. When a German would do some wrong, well, one knew to hide and he wouldn't find us, and if he didn't find us we would thank God, he hadn't found us. If a Jewish militia man would want to do to us something so we were very much perturbed and say, "One Jews wants to do that to another Jew. That is something horrible." But we got accustomed to this also. We have learned to guard ourselves, to be on guard against our militia as well as against the Germans. Even more so. I shall refrain from telling you much more about the same thing, but I want to tell you just a little episode at which I myself happened to be present. It is just an example, to see to what all that has led. The Jewish militia did not feel that they were merely functionaries to execute what was demanded from them and what was ordered them to do. They also felt that they were better, more important people. Here is a case that happened once. In <a class="placename" href="#vothL83">Dabrowa-Wolnitza</a> there was a shop. That is an industry where shoes are manufactured. This industry was founded by a German who was the manager, and only Jews worked there.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="kimmelmannA" start="2470.474" end="x">Yes, they were getting paid, but I told you already what the money was worth. They worked only to prolong a bit their stay at home. They were still thinking that if one works for the <a class="term" href="#vothG_wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> they will be allowed to stay at home. Large numbers of the workers would arrive from Bensburg. Special Jewish street cars, electric street cars. They were given by the street car company. Jewish street cars. Every two hours a street car would go especially for the Jews. No Germans, no Poles could board such a train, a car, only Jews. There were Jewish conductors and the Jewish militia always controlled the street cars so that nobody would smuggle bread or anything else. Because there always used to happen that there was a difference in price between one city and the other. In most cases bread was cheaper in <a class="placename" href="#vothL83">Dabrowa</a> than in Bensburg. And so they always controlled the trams to watch that nobody should smuggle anything. They also stood guard otherwise on the street car. There happened to be on the car a Jewish militia man, tall of stature, and of strong build, and it was early in the morning when the working men were traveling to work. It is understood that if there is only every two hours a streetcar the cars were badly overcrowded. The Jewish militiaman felt to be better than we, the people, and he wanted that we make room for him. But the train was so packed that people were standing on the steps, so what does he do. He tells a man to make room for him. So the man says, "Have a bit of sense, it's impossible, it's all packed. We are pressed together like herring." But, he the militiaman, didn't say much, he just struck him. One doesn't consider in the first moments what the consequences may be and he struck back. But the other one was much stronger, and he beat him so that it didn't pay any more [to defend himself]. But the militiaman was not satisfied, and when they arrived in <a class="placename" href="#vothL83">Dabrowa</a> he takes that Jew to the Jewish police station and they beat him up to such an extent that the man was unrecognizable.</span>

There were outside a few Jews around, they somehow protested, but what could one do? One had to keep his mouth shut. [While the man went to his place of work] he [the Jewish militiaman] went immediately to the Bensburg police. He went to the Jewish police commandant too, and he brought with himself numerous militiamen and they wanted to get into the shop. To get the Jew. But it was fortunate that he [the gateman] called up the German manager and he gave orders that nobody was to come in. And that the gateman could not permit anyone to enter. That was a fortunate thing because otherwise I do not think we should have seen him alive. This is just an example to what that all has led. I mean, if you take people, and they only look for this and that kind of people, they looked only for a kind of people who had no morals. Who did not have too much of morals and not too much of sentiment.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="kimmelmannA" start="2731.718" end="x">When I saw all these occurrences at the time, I started thinking, What really is a human being? I have heard, I knew that time vaguely, that there are people of all kinds, and all kinds of governments. And I have asked myself is it possible that if somebody from birth has a definite character, whether such a character never alters, during life. But I came to a conclusion that the basic character never changes. But the detailed aspects change a great deal. For example, for instance, let us look at a tree. The roots, they are rooted deep and the base of a tree is always a tree. A tree follows the wind. When the wind blows in this direction, the branches follow the same direction. That is what I have compared with the character of man. Conditions demand that the character of a man bend itself a bit and he follow the conditions which contribute to it. One could see people, intelligent people, educated people, learned people, of whom one could never think that they are capable of certain things, or of such things. Nevertheless, the conditions of the Nazi terror have led them to a complete change. What could one expect from them? In general, you would say what could one not expect from them. And they, themselves, never thought probably, before, that they would be capable of doing such things. I now want to go to what I have seen in the camps and to prove my point I just want to state that in Dulag [a contraction of Durchgangslager, a transit camp] it was the same situation. They would trust those who would do such things that in some respects were worse than the Germans [did] themselves, and if I want to judge] such a person, I put myself into his situation. I imagine what would I have done if I would have been in his place? That's why I say, today one could say if one would ask me a question, if they would have offered you to become a militia man, what would you have done? Today one can say if one does not want to be [truthful], "Yes, I definitely would have refused." I would never have taken such a dirty job. But one can never be sure that if it would come to it, that one would simply have replied, "I don't want to do it." Because a human being is only a human being. If one stands over him with a gun and he is being threatened‚Äîif you don't do that you shall lose your life‚Äîone cannot be responsible for the deeds that one may perpetrate. And in such light one also has to see the Jewish militia. In this, thought, they too did horrible things in which I think that all people are alike. There are only a few heroes who have that much courage, who have so much will power to use it; that if one looks at the average man, it generally will appear to him that his life is of greater value. Or let us not say that it is of greater value‚Äîhe has not the courage and not such a strong will to decline the proposition. Let us now go over to the facts. What has really happened? I don't want to go into the other details which have happened until I got into the camp. The razzias came on and on, and they took on increasingly threatening aspects. They took more and more Jews, and when it came to it, they took old people, sick people, people who had no occupation, whether they received lists or summonses, but the order was that [then and then??] On a Saturday afternoon they should appear in the Jewish synagogue. The synagogue wasn't any more a synagogue, it was just an empty house. Later it was even converted to a horse stable. The thing made a terrible impression and people thought‚Äînow it is coming to the worst‚Äîbecause it was known for what purpose people [were sent away??]. Those incapable of doing anything, sick, old, and children, and it was known that they were being led directly to death. Those who had the slightest chance went into hiding. Many were afraid even to hide. So were the people taken by terror that even, although they knew that they were going to a certain death, they were afraid to hide.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="kimmelmannA" start="3129.974" end="x">Yes, they were deceived. They were told that they were being sent to a place where they would have light work, according to their ability to perform, and in this way they will be interned during the time of the war. And on the one hand, they wanted it to be a bit quieter. This also led to the fact that many people just didn't go into hiding. They thought that if they catch me here, my life is lost right now. And there possibly I will survive the war. And so on that Sunday the first transport departed and none of those people is alive. These things happened in the following manner; there were two German organizations who dealt in total with the whole Jewish population. The one was called the Special Task force and the other one the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a>. Under the first division came the old, the sick, as I mentioned before. But since there were not enough of these, they hit upon some other procedures. Each person who ever was subject to a penalty, if, for instance, he crossed the street not according to rules which were determined for the Jews, he then had to pay a fine. But if he didn't have the money on him, then a protocol [ticket] was written out. This protocol would go to the central police office and there a list would be made out, and that list be sent to the Jewish Community Council, indicating that these people were criminals. And these people had to sign an affidavit that as criminals they are going to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>[??]. These were the tricks that were played on people. It was simply, so to speak, chicanery, because if one wants to find something against a person, he can always find it. Once they would say that the Star of David was not properly sewed on‚Äîthat one point was detached; such a person was already considered a criminal. And he was sent to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>[??]. But finally the Special Task Force began to notice that soon they would not have to do anything, so they also took it upon themselves the supply of Jewish labor; so that the Special Task Force would not have to return to Germany and go to war. That would have happened if they would have sent them all to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. So when the Special Task Force and the contingent set up[??] a working camp [it is not very clear to which camp he refers]. From these people as we heard, the reports were very bad, and a lot of people had died from starvation and from the duress of labor. A very small number of these, we later heard, were still alive. Otherwise they all went kaput. [One should notice here the meaning of the word "kaput." "Kaput" is applied, usually, to objects, not to living beings. It is applied to objects when one speaks of breaking it to pieces. A child makes a toy "kaput". A machine, improperly handled, goes "kaput". And that was the term that one heard consistently‚Äî"kaput gemacht"‚Äîthe term that apparently has been used by the Nazis for the designation of a person who was killed or otherwise perished. The concept of man was used as an object, not a living being.] I had luck at that time. Two days before this deportation[??] [apparently the first of the deportees was sent to a labor camp] I was accepted to work in a metal shop. At that time I was accepted on trial to see whether I was at all fit for this kind of work. I wanted to work but there was nowhere to get the training. There was no chance to learn. One had to produce. It was a munitions factory; I was accepted, and they gave me a certificate that I was admitted for a try-out. And on this certificate I was set free [was left at liberty]. Because that was a plant belonging to a German and under such conditions I got a blue card which meant a certificate for [people] who were working for the Germans. These people were permitted to stay at home and at that time everybody said‚Äîthese people will remain at home for good. And I was happy that I was accepted at such a plant. Soon they ran short of pink cards [he did not explain what a pink card meant; apparently they were for people who were not working for the Germans]. They were all sent away to Germany and so the turn came now of the others. So they started taking people, who, though they worked for the Germans, did not work in war plants, As for instance, the large business houses, or a kind of private business and the like. The turn came for these people, But they did not make a selection. That in a certain place, a former orphanage, which was the point of assembly, and there each master with his Jewish employees, each German master had to appear with his workers and a committee appointed by the Special Task Force . . . they investigated the matter and each proprietor and each manager was forced to surrender a certain per cent of his workers for transportation to Germany. At that time I fared very well because my plant was a war plant. He had no other Jews but me, it took only a few minutes and I was set free right away. You can imagine that my mother was immensely happy when she heard how easy I got by. And the Chief told me then, "Well, Abraham, you should not be afraid. As long as you work for the shops of Walter Hefke, the firm's name was Walter Hefke, you have nothing to fear, [do not be afraid] that you will be deported. We have a good plant and you are a good worker, and we will take care of you." A human being is a human being. In general one finds himself in a bad situation and every good word which one hears from a person one believes. That is innate in a person. I believe it to be so, and then it was already 1942. I worked then in the war plant. I endeavored to produce the most that I believed would help me to remain home and the first transports of blue cards have left meanwhile for Germany. Things have quieted down a bit, but then came the turn of my father. The father was then still at home. He was ill.</span>

[He stuttered at that point he apparently wanted to say that she was born in 1928, and then simply calculated her age, it also appears that he was blocked emotionally by the memories of his sister.] She was possibly fourteen. She was one year older than I. Well, we managed somehow to arrange things. Then came the turn of the girls. Up to then the girls were safe. They did not send girls to labor service[??]. But then it occurred to them that young girls also can work, and orders were given that all girls from sixteen to twenty-five years of age, shall appear at the Community Council to be examined, to see whether they are well, whether they are healthy, and then to be sent to a work camp. Although then they were still paying attention to the conditions of health, and those who were not very well were told that they can still remain at home and work, but only on the condition that they continue working. And of course nobody was avoiding work. Whether he wanted to or not, everyone had to work in order to remain home. And by that time, the shop of which I have told you, it existed for some time, but not many girls worked there. But since a cousin of mine was an overseer over the whole shop, so we had a pull with him and among the first girls he also put my sister to work‚Äîhe took on my sister. And in such a way, she remained home. [It seems they were playing safe; the girls had to appear from the age of sixteen and his sister was only fourteen.]</span>

What they manufactured there is not entirely clear to me. We were reasonably lucky. We remained constantly home from the deportations[??]. Because we had the good cards. We too would say always, maybe it will remain so until the end of the war. Maybe we shall manage to remain together. One day, that was on Swuot, that was a Jewish holiday, Swuot, at night, maybe it was 12 o'clock, came the Jewish militia, they had a long list, they took my father out of his bed, and then [led him away??]. But in the morning I heard that the Community Council in <a class="placename" href="#vothL83">Dabrowa</a> took them to the Polish Police, in the white building in Bensburg, and there I saw him through the window. I talked to him a few words, then there came an <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> man and we were not permitted anymore to stand there, otherwise they would have taken us to work. If one would go into the cellar [in hiding], one had no strength to work in the morning.

There were people who constructed special cellars. Cellars which were really hidden, but we couldn't afford it. So again some time passed with all these events.

Everything is being done automatically. Yet how is a person feeling? It was especially with me that way because I had it reasonable well. It was then already my turn‚Äîthey looked already for people like me, but I don't know‚ÄîI learned from some kind of a source that on a certain night there will be a razzia [a raid], and I told it to my Chief.</span>

My blood stopped functioning when they told me that. Because it dealt not only with me alone, because I was ready to work hard, I had courage and was always imagining the worst, because if one expects the worst it is much easier to stand it than when one acts in the opposite fashion. But the worst was for me the separation from my mother and my sister. And that drove me to premonitions.

So five minutes before nine, she comes home and tells me I should dress immediately; she has heard that there will be again a raid, I must hide. Besides, [they are after] boys of my age and with the same identity cards as mine. I didn't think long, I dressed with whatever came into my hands. I went to a comrade of mine, and we hid in an attic; it was rather unrecognizable and we slept there. It was winter, it was cold, you can imagine that we couldn't sleep from sheer cold, but we passed the night. I tell you that only to give you an example. To give people kind of general review of the horrors in which we lived. We were never sure of the moment nor of the hour. We never felt at home. Always there was the fear that an <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> man, a <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> man, may come, or the Jewish militiamen who could fetch us.

That is, the Jews had to live in a concentrated fashion, in certain section, but they were not permitted to go out‚Äîcould not go on the streets where non-Jews lived. On the other hand, the Poles could come in [to the ghetto]. She worked for Christians. That was not permitted‚Äîto work for Christians. But, as the Poles could move through those streets, they could take walks through those streets, so it was possible to work for them. As long as I talk about it I will tell you how that work would proceed. When my mother worked in the daytime, she would return home by five o'clock and work then until one or two o'clock at night. When she was through with her work, her sewing machine was hidden, because it was not permitted to us to have sewing machines. The machines had to be surrendered. But on the machine depended her life. If we have nothing to eat, we have to die anyway. This risk we had to take, whether we wanted to or not. So after work, we would hide the machine in the attic or in the cellar. And so at that time, too, my mother thought that it was possibly a customer who is calling for some work, or wants to order something‚Äîand we wanted to earn something‚Äîso she quickly opened the door and asked, "Who is there?" But she did not see anybody outside. But the policeman who was outside heard a voice calling, he was glad he came on time, and so he entered the house.</span>

He comes in and asks for me, where Kimmelmann Abram lives, and my mother was already not anymore[??] a human being. She already did not know what was happening to her, because she knew that the last minute has come. The minute of decision. And she asked [The sequence is lost again, apparently through emotional stress] . . . I said, "Yes, that's I," and he ordered that I should dress immediately. I had my work clothes on the chair, these were clothes full of grease because I worked at the stamping machine always with oil, very dirty, just for work. Otherwise, one couldn't wear them. One would become all greasy and dirty, from the dirty oil. I wanted to put on something else because I knew I would not return anymore home but he did not permit it. I should put on these things and so I should come with him. And while I was dressing he did something else, and that was to start searching whether we have any food. Because they were so shrewd, they knew we have a card that would give us only the utmost minimum to live on. It was as people say, not to live and not to die. And when they would find any more food, any kind of edibles put away, they inquired immediately how we managed to have it. That would give a reason to punish one or consider him a criminal. And then they had reason to send one to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. They found some beans in our house but my mother managed to explain, saying that we have not eaten anything [any beans] for weeks in order to cook once a real meal. I don't know what happened afterwards. Maybe he has written it down, maybe not. I was all crazy, I didn't think of such things at the moment; we thought only of the fact that now the time has come that I won't see anymore my mother. I knew right away that I shall not return anymore and when I finished dressing he told me to come with him and when we left Mother began so to scream, it was something terrible. When somebody [who] doesn't know at all about such things [and] he hears a woman so screaming, he must definitely think that she is off her mind. And it's no wonder when one hears such hysterical screams. But even if one cannot imagine [it] one should still be able to know what it is when a child is being torn form his mother, when one knows at the time for sure that she wouldn't see him anymore. This cannot be compared with a case when a child dies, is sick and dies in its own bed. It's perfectly different when one knows that it is going to be together with the mother and then, all at once, being sent, so to speak, to death. And if I live today, I don't know to this day how I was saved from all that. But then I was sure that I am going towards death. So was my mother. So one should not wonder that my mother screamed that way. He [apparently the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> man] heard it, yet from the outside. And I don't know how it affected him‚Äîit made some impression on him. He returned with me and asked my mother why she screamed so. But she was afraid to say why she screamed.</span>

When she heard such words, although from the German from whom she could not expect anything, in spite of that, she consoled herself within and thought that maybe he might be telling the truth. She quieted down a bit‚ÄîI knew that that wouldn't last long. It was a matter that was decided in a few hours‚Äîwhat was there to do? He mounted his bike and told me to run along beside him.

One doesn't have the courage. One always thinks‚Äîthere is always still a spark in a human being that tells, maybe there still will happen a miracle. One tried to hold only to one thing. One thinks only of one thing. I was running and I had no strength anymore. When I came to the Police station, which was from us about a kilometer and a half, there I had to run. So he was on the bike, so he tells me I should put the bike into the stalls. I was then for the first time in the police station. I didn't know where the stalls were. So I only asked him where, and he right away slapped my face once, and once again.</span>

All at once one came in, looked at me, he saw that I wore the star of David so he knew that I was a Jew, so he disliked that I turned my face towards him. So he took me in a corner with my face to the wall, my hands down, just like a criminal. I was not permitted to move. At the slightest move I would get a slap in the face or a kick with a boot. So I stood for an hour and a half and then they brought in two Polish women to the police station; they were those who did business on the black. They had with them eggs, butter, and all kinds of foodstuffs, and we were sent together to Bensburg, to the lower police division.</span>

On the street car they performed such a trick. They didn't want to transport me just in a simple fashion although they were not much ashamed or much embarrassed in any way, but still they did it better. They took all the packages which the two women brought with themselves. They made me carry them, so the people should think that I have smuggled something‚Äîthat I was trading on the black. That's why they are taking me. In spite of all that, first I was ashamed; and second, these were heavy bundles. What the two women were carrying, I had to carry by myself. When we arrived there they took the bundles away from me and they did not present me to anybody but sent me down right away into a cellar, and there were assembled many Jews, that is, several hundred Jews, and we spent there a few hours. Now I want to come back to explain how it happened that they looked for me at lunch time at home. And why. Precisely this Shupo . . .</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="kimmelmannA" start="4940.518" end="x">A Shupo, I told you before, is a policeman, a kind of guard. It happened like this. They looked for me at that time at night. But they looked for me in Bensburg, because I was registered as working in Bensburg. Since I did not live in Bensburg, the could not find me in Bensburg because it did not occur to them that I was at night in the plant. They have taken only those who they could find at home. And so they caught many of those who were sleeping at home, and when the Police Chief, when the Shupos would come to the Police Chief and would make the reports, and I was not among them, so they started thinking where I could be; and they looked up the registers and saw that I don't live in Bensburg at all, that I lived in <a class="placename" href="#vothL83">Dabrowa</a>. So they quickly telephoned to the police in <a class="placename" href="#vothL83">Dabrowa</a> and they looked for me at home. [There is one word that I cannot understand.] That time I was unlucky. And they caught me. And that is how it happened; otherwise maybe I would have remained yet for some time at home until the general deportation‚Äîuntil the place became Jew-clean. Fate governs man and he can't do different. One can't fight against it, and so I arrived in time to be at the police station in Bensburg together with all the Jews. They did not give us anything to eat, they even wouldn't let us out when one had to go to the toilet and in the evening they brought again a cordon of police which was supposed to take us to <a class="placename" href="#vothL98">Sosnowice</a>. <a class="placename" href="#vothL98">Sosnowice</a> was the transit camp. It was called for short Dulag [which meant Durchganslager] which means a transit camp. All those who were taken to Germany, that is, to the work <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, were sent to Dulag. On the other hand, those who were going to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a> were sent to Bensburg, to that orphanage Sirotinez. Since I was still well and young they took me to work and I was sent to Dulag. They led us on foot. We had to run. They did not order any transport facilities, we had to run about eight kilometers and you can imagine that for every five men, we marched five abreast. There were two soldiers and one dog. That is, they marched on both sides, and for each row of five men.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="kimmelmannA" start="5114.782" end="x">For those dogs they sooner had food than for the Jews. They would say, when they shot a Jew that they have one bread left over, and then they could feel the dog. Moreover, there was not yet any scarcity for the Germans, so to speak. They could have enough, and precisely because they could take away from us. When the Germans would run short of something the ration of the Jews would be diminished and the problem was solved. Nobody cared whether some Jew would die of starvation. That was their purpose. But they couldn't stop giving to eat. Maybe they figured it might result in epidemics of tuberculosis or typhus which would harm them as well. That was the only reason why they gave the Jews to eat at all. Otherwise they would have let them die of starvation right away. When we arrived at the Dulag, we had not eaten all day, that means I slept during the day time and when one sleeps one doesn't eat. At ten that night they gave us two potatoes, two potatoes in jacket and that was our whole supper. At the transit camp thing were like this. The employees of the camp were Jews. They were free. Then in <a class="placename" href="#vothL98">Sosnowice</a> were still many Jews. They were permitted to go home and they were simply there [in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>] employed. They were there as employees. They took care of everything. They saw to it that there was order. There were also ten Western Jews. These were Jews who were already once in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, and I don't know, I can't remember anymore how they happened to come to this transit camp. At any rate, they became the personnel of the transit camp and it was necessary to sweep to keep things clean and take care of the kitchen, and that was done by the ten Western Jews. Otherwise, we were guarded by police of the special task force. As I told you already, the special task force was responsible for the workers. Also they were guarding us. And there was the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> chief, not the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> chief but the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> <a class="term" href="#vothG_fuehrer">Fuehrer</a>, a German, an officer, that was a scoundrel of a kind that I haven't seen anybody worse until then, also a plain sadist.

He had lost a leg in the war and he was rewarded by being made a chief of all the shops and he managed them. He, as people were talking about him, they were telling that he was a very good man. He has done a great deal for the Jew, but an order came to Grenow [the previously mentioned town might be Grenow, not Kradow], that it should be made "Jew-clean" and he couldn't do a thing about it, and so we were thinking that tonight there comes a whole transport from Grenow [could also be spelled Krenau]. Men and women, mostly young people, because in Grenow there was a selection. The old men, women and children‚Äîthey were sent directly from there to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>, but the younger ones were intended for a working <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> so they were sent to the transit <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> in Dulag near <a class="placename" href="#vothL98">Sosnowiec</a>. When they arrived‚Äîand there were several hundred people‚Äîyou can imagine how crowded it became. And we really didn't have any more room to sleep. At night, when they shut the doors . . . and it was something terrible. There was, so to speak, no air in the hall. We were just waiting for the morning when the doors would be opened again. And when the doors were reopened the people were simply stuck in the doorway [from crowding] and they couldn't get out anymore. Probably you will ask why? When a few people squeezed themselves into the doorway first to catch some air, and they all remained standing because it was narrow and they couldn't get ahead and from behind they were pushing. There would not be a day when somebody wasn't trampled or killed [kaput beaten]. They were pushing him and they were yelling, "Why don't you go ahead?" Under such conditions one ceases to be human, one gasps for air, one wants to get it, and wants to get out, and one doesn't consider that it is nobody's fault but the Germans whose fault it is. But one doesn't consider it any more. One isn't anymore a human being. And so things happened every morning. From Grenow had come mostly young people. And so it was with all transports. Various people have crowded themselves in with them. In Grenow there was made a selection and the parents were sent to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. There were still some small children and women who, in an unnoticeable fashion, have mingled in among those sent to the labor camps and in that way, they arrived in <a class="placename" href="#vothL98">Sosnowiec</a>. They would say, yes, these are saved, they will get into a work <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, but in the transit camp there was a new selection. Daily there arrived trucks from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> and transported the people to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. Selections were something terrible. Because every day we were lined up on the square and counted, whether someone was not missing, and a man from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> would go through the lines. If he would dislike somebody he would simply send him to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>.</span>

There were no privileged. All people. Every living being. Every Jewish living being. A child one day old or an old man who could not stand on his feet. All had to come to the square and their photograph identification cards had to be stamped. I shall have to tell you what these photograph identification cards are.

At the beginning when the Germans [arrived], they were taking fingerprints of the whole Polish population, Jews or no Jews. It was right at the beginning. Then they wanted to make a distinction between the Poles and the Jews, so they made for the Jews special photograph identification cards. Everyone had to have his picture taken to get his identification card and the photograph was pasted on the identification card, so that when they demanded from a Jew his identification card, they could immediately see whether it is the corresponding person. Since with finger prints you have to make all sorts of experiments to control it‚Äîso this was for them much easier.</span>

Now you will know what a photograph identification card is. So they played such a trick in <a class="placename" href="#vothL581">Wolbrom</a> [I don't hear the name clearly] which was not far from us. There Jews still lived. They assembled all on the square and had their photograph identification cards restamped by the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> by the special task force, and they were sent home again. Later it resulted to be just a trick. That is, in <a class="placename" href="#vothL581">Wolbrom</a>, there weren't any Jews, but in the district of <a class="placename" href="#vothL83">Dabrowa</a>, <a class="placename" href="#vothL101">Bendzin</a>, and <a class="placename" href="#vothL98">Sosnowiec</a> there were still some fifty thousand Jews or more and all these they wanted to get in one day, so they let all the Jews free in <a class="placename" href="#vothL581">Wolbrom</a> [after the checkup] so we should not be afraid any more. And so they posted announcements on all the streets that, on such and such a day, that we should assemble in a certain place. They will only stamp the identification cards and everybody will go home afterwards. We didn't like the idea very well.</span>

Pretty soon, it became clear why they arranged it that way. I want to tell you briefly what occurred. The screaming was terrible because the families were simply separated. Young men who had a colored card were sent there, a mother was sent to another place, and in a family where only the minority was working, the whole family was taken. It was really the reason for the rule that people were to appear in family units, so that those, even if they were working, but made up the minority in the family/that seems to be the meaning, the wire is not clear] should also get their turn [which means should also be deported, maybe he clarifies it later]. We stepped forward, my mother, my sister and I, and here my sister had a good card, my mother too, I too had a good card, but my mother looked that time very bad because we didn't earn very much and she would not eat well [here are a few words all unintelligible but it seems to mean the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> man has noticed her] and so he thought that such a woman cannot work anymore.

But I had a very good card and when we got there the president of the Jewish Community Council was there, and he looked at me. And I still had my card in my hand. He said, in Polish, "What's going on? Why were you sent here?" And I didn't know myself. But I was so lucky, I am telling you that it's undescribable; because the Jewish Militia was acting this way. He [the German] would point with the finger that one belongs to a certain group, and he wasn't given any time, even a second, even to say goodbye to somebody. He was immediately dragged to the corresponding place and he could not show himself anymore. Whether the father was put there and the son here, they could not say anymore a word to each other. But not so with me. They looked at my card, and to some extent they were taking a chance, because if the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> would have seen it they would have immediately slapped him in the face, or taken notice of it in some other fashion. But I was sent back in line again. I should stay there again. My mother was happy. She didn't think anymore of herself, that she is in such danger, and in danger she was. She only thought how to save me from it. And when I passed again he set me free and I went to No. 1.</span>

A fellow who was about twenty-five years old‚Äîhe was so excited; maybe he was nervously sick, or maybe he became nervously sick that time . . . and he passed a fence, you understand, a picket fence [they were thick logs deep in the ground], and we don't know how he got the strength . . . that wasn't his strength but the strength of his nerves, I am sure of that, because there is no human strength of that could in such a moment do such a thing. We barely noticed it. He simply put his hand down, and a log was pulled out. Just out of fear and excitement. And we were walking as if from a cemetery, so we wept and we wailed. When we arrived home, the door was locked. We forgot to take the key from our mother. The door was locked, and we broke a window and got in. What could we do? One was forbidden to show himself on the street. But still we couldn't obey. Soon I went out. I saw only a single Jew on the street, and I approached the Jewish Community Council. I don't know. Although I knew that my mother was sent right away to Bensburg because she was in No. 3, still I went on. The police were still around and we were hiding from behind one house after the other so that they shouldn't see us. Finally I arrived at the Jewish Community Council. Upstairs there was a balcony, they were locked up upstairs, but they did them a favor and let them out on the balcony, and all at once I hear my name being called. I turn around and see my mother. I saw my mother; she held the key in her hand, and threw it from a distance. I didn't know what was happening to me. I didn't know how she got into No. 2, because she was assigned to No. 3. Well, I was overjoyed because it said that No.2 will remain overnight in <a class="placename" href="#vothL83">Dabrowa</a> and they will be re-examined. I went home. I told it right away to my sister; I told my sister right away that she is in No. 2, and she cheered up a bit. But barely an hour passed that all these people were taken, with them my mother, and they were driven to Bensburg, on foot. As I learned afterwards they were driven like cattle. They were forced to step on each other's feet.</span>

As they used to say, "They wouldn't dirty their mouth or their hands." They took the club as an interpreter and when one would not fall in line, he would be clubbed. We remained home. We could not go out after ten o'clock. We did not know for sure where the people were taken. Still we had a kind of feeling that they were also taken to Bensburg, to the orphanage. Came six o'clock in the morning, and I told you before I had permission to travel to Bensburg from <a class="placename" href="#vothL83">Dabrowa</a> because I worked there, so I took the first streetcar and I went to Bensburg. I came to the orphanage, along the street that led to the orphanage. A Jew told me I should not go there because they may arrest me too, because there are standing <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> people. When they see somebody they just grab him. So I thought thus, "I want to be together with my mother, but as long as I am free I still can possibly do something; maybe I still could save her. But if we two are there, there is no more hope." I took the streetcar and I traveled on without any consciousness of myself. And all that happened at the same time in <a class="placename" href="#vothL83">Dabrowa</a>, <a class="placename" href="#vothL98">Sosnowiec</a>, and Bensburg. And the only difference was that in <a class="placename" href="#vothL83">Dabrowa</a> everything was over in one day because there were only five thousand heads, but in Bensburg and <a class="placename" href="#vothL98">Sosnowiec</a> it still lasted until the next day. It was Wednesday and Thursday and it still continued the next morning. I took the streecar, I traveled on, without any aim. And here there was a stop. I went off without knowing what I was doing and here I stand before a house where my aunt lived. I was running as if in sleep. I come in and here my cousin was crying. I didn't need to ask her about anything. I understood what was going on. Neither did I tell her about my mother, because how could she help me? I didn't tell her anything. I wept with her, and I left. I left the house and all at once I was taking the streetcar on my way back. There on the streetcar I see again a girl cousin of mine, from <a class="placename" href="#vothL98">Sosnowiec</a>. Her parents also lived in <a class="placename" href="#vothL83">Dabrowa</a>. Precisely on the day of the selection her parents lived with us. They lived with us then for about a week because they were evicted from a street. They still had no apartment, and so they lived with us. I know that her parents also were assigned to No. 3. I didn't want to tell her, but I saw right away that she knows it already because she wept terribly. I just greeted her, but we didn't say a word. But she had great connections in the Community Council. At first I had the intention to turn to her for help, but since her parents were in the same situation, she, of course, would, and I in her place would have done the same thing, first try to do something for her parents. To save them. I didn't say anything except I told her that my mother, too, is there in the orphanage and I went home. When I arrived home there were at the streetcar people and more people. All those who remained home. And they begged the militia, maybe one could do this and one could do that. And that same day a Jew had given twenty thousand marks to a Jewish militiaman that he should save his father. I want to tell you it was within the possibility of a militiaman to save some individuals. It was so. At night the guard was assisted by the Jewish militia; so they could pass up certain things. If somebody would escape, they wouldn't report them. That was for money. So it was just a single case where a son saved his father with twenty thousand marks. So when we returned to <a class="placename" href="#vothL83">Dabrowa</a> the people were waiting for the militia. Even to transmit a letter you had to pay an awful lot of money, just to transmit a little package. What could I expect? We had no money. There was nothing for me to do but to hope. Oh, I had some hope, but I did not believe myself that I will see my mother again. So I come home, tell everything to my sister, and again I go to Bensburg. Now I go to my plant where I was employed, where I worked. As I entered there stood my boss, his assistant, and here I all at once began to scream and to weep. And he says, "What's going on?" And so I say, "Why shouldn't I cry if my mother was taken to her death." So he says, "Who?" So I say, "What do you mean, who. I don't have to tell you. You know very well." So he says, "Wait, when Matisha come (that was his manager) he shall go with you to the special police. Maybe something could be done." I told him if I don't have my mother I won't come anymore to work. "It's all the same to me." He didn't do it because he was afraid of me, but possibly he took pity on me.</span>

I was waiting for Matisha, his manager, as if for a Messiah, like the Jews were expecting a Messiah. I turned back again; I had no patience. And so I went back again. I went behind the plant and wept. Here was the toilet. A few women workers passed from the plant to the toilet and when they saw me they said, "Abraham, what has happened? Why do you weep?"</span>

So they say, "Why do you weep?" So I told them the whole story. And so they just shook their heads and what could they do. As they returned to the plant they told it to the foreman head. He came out right away and said, "Why do you cry? Your mother is upstairs with the Deratishes. Your mother is with the family Deratish upstairs." Now I shall tell you who the family Deratish was. In the place where I worked, that place was formerly a barn for cattle feed. And when the war started, the owner of the place had a lot of money, and so he bought some machinery and wanted to open a shop. But the Germans came and confiscated the place.</span>

            </span>
            <span class="utterance" who="kimmelmannA" start="7009.915" end="x">No, he was not a Jew. He was a Pole. They found that the place was good for a plant. They wanted to expand it, they made wonderful plans, they wanted to build it up and put in more machinery. They confiscated the place in such a manner that the whole business was transferred in the name of the German, and the Pole remained there as some kind of a supply man. His business was to obtain materials. He had to supervise the work, see that things were properly done, well, be a sort of supervisor. But he was on a straight salary, nothing else. And in the house where he lived, also lived his in-laws. They were very nice and because I worked in the plant, and my mother frequently used to come over there, although she had no right to go to Bensburg‚Äîbut people were running across the fields on foot; sometimes it was necessary‚Äîwhen I slept there as I told you before. Well, they got somehow acquainted so they knew each other. And the man says, "She is upstairs." In that moment I just did not understand what he was saying. I think‚Äîwell, if it would have come to my consciousness what he is telling me I would have kissed him; I don't know myself what I would have done. And so I let him stay there and I run upstairs. Lo, there is my mother in bed, and the old man puts compresses on her knees, and the old woman is preparing some food for her, and so on, like one acts in such a situation. And then it didn't occur to me at the moment even to ask her how she happened to be there. I let her stay there, lie there. I immediately returned home and told it to my sister, and took again the next streetcar and returned again. I brought her some food and when I got upstairs I asked her, "Mother, how did you do it? How do you happened to be here?" And she told me thus: That night she was led to the second story of the orphanage, that is, her group, No. 2. On the other hand No. 3, that is, those who were definitely assigned for deportation were on the third floor.</span>

            </span>
            <span class="utterance" who="kimmelmannA" start="7157.973" end="x">Wait a minute. That's precisely what I asked her. How did you get to No. 2? She told me this. When I was freed she began to think of herself. She knew that is is not only a question of herself, but the fact that she will be separated from us. And when the rain started and it got dark and the people began to wail, the militia was trying to create order among the people. So she took advantage of the situation and went over to No. 2. She could then even pass to No. 1, but she didn't know yet what it really meant, 1 or 2. People didn't know because various people were in each group. As I told you before, if only the minority of a family were working the whole family was assigned for deportation. But they didn't know that they were selecting them according to age and general appearance and so quite different people were seen in each group. For example, in a family of which only one son was working, and the son was well developed, was good looking, he nevertheless was put, too in No. 3. And we didn't know, that it is on account of only a minority working in the family. In other words, we didn't know which is the best group. But my mother thought that No. 2 was good. So she went over there. So she managed to smuggle herself over to No. 2 and she thought that already she was safe and free. But she right away started wondering why I and my sister were not there. She understood that she had made a great mistake. She couldn't do anything more and she remained in No. 2. And in this manner she meanwhile has saved herself for No. 3. So when she got to the first floor [in Europe the first floor is really the floor above the street level, what we would have called here the second floor], she tried to do everything possible to get away from there. They were sitting there all night, and people got out through the door and wanted to pass through the gate. When one was caught he was taken immediately to the third floor. So this she couldn't do. So you see it was a great risk to attempt to get away from No. 2, because a lot of people wished that they were in No. 2 on the first floor, that is, those who were on the third floor wished it. All the things that occurred that night and the fights and the like, and so on, are not to be told here. I want to tell how my mother saved herself, was saved from there. It was five o'clock in the morning and at half past five the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> was to take over the guard service. Nobody knew it, but that is how it happened. It was five o'clock and my mother noticed that a man took off his belt from his trousers, hung it at the window and jumped out of the window. He jumped down. She could not see whether he escaped or not, but the belt remained hanging. Without thinking much she got an idea which is rather unusual for a woman. She did the same thing.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="kimmelmannA" start="7351.593" end="x">Yes, and it was quite high because the ground floor was very high. It wasn't a simple building, and it was quite high. One had to have quite a bit of courage to do such a thing. And since she had no experience in such things and didn't know how to do it, so instead of coming down in the jump on her toes she came down on the entire foot. And she dislocated the joint. She couldn't run anymore and she couldn't get up. The guard noticed it and went to drag her through the gate, this time into No. 3. And here appeared all at once a girl who lived with us together, a neighbor of ours, also a Jewess whose mother also was in the orphanage. She also tried to do something for her mother. When she saw that the militiaman wanted to drag my mother again into the orphange, she got inspired with courage. She was a strong and healthy girl, and she told him that if he didn't let my mother go she would start something. I don't know why and my mother didn't know either, but he simply let her go free and went back to the gate and resumed his guard duty. He paid no more attention to my mother. And my mother ran on her knees (she couldn't walk anymore on her feet and she was about a kilometer away from the place where I was working) and she went up to the Deratishes and in this way she was saved. We had to take her back to <a class="placename" href="#vothL83">Dabrowa</a> and she couldn't walk. If she could walk we thought we could run through the fields and nobody would see us, but she couldn't walk. I went to my boss and asked for some sort of certificate, if only temporary, to say that my mother is working here, and that she could pass in case somebody meets her on the street. So he told me to call the coachman, he should harness the horses to the car, pack it with hay, and hide my mother underneath. And so I did, and I brought my mother home. Five weeks my mother was lying home.</span>

In that raincoat she had all her identification papers, the special card and the photo-card. Now when we got home we were afraid to get out again without some registration papers. First of all one has to have an identification paper and second that identification paper had to be stamped. All those who were assigned to remain had their photo-cards stamped, but she had lost her raincoat (she left it upstairs; it was all so sudden she did not bother about such minor things), and without an identification one could not appear on the street. Even at home one was not safe. If somebody comes, say an official, and says: "Show me your photo-card," and if one doesn't have it . . . We tried to ask various militiamen maybe they could fetch it. But who cared? They had of course to take care of their own. My mother remained in bed for four weeks. Her leg was put in a cast.</span>

One day there comes a certain Judkevitz, that was his name, also from Bensburg.

We just didn't know what he was saying. Well, I went immediately to Bensburg and there my cousin tells me this: She has an acquaintance, a militiaman who visits her‚Äîshe was already married; he was just a friend who would come to see her. And he tells her that he has found a photo-card and he doesn't know to whom it belongs. So he takes out the photo-card and when my cousin saw on it my mother she recognized her and said, "That's my aunt," and in this way my mother got back her photo-card, and also her raincoat. But I tell you the whole story just sounds more like a fairy tale, like a legend. Things fitting together in such a way. Here her identification card all at once is being saved through a neighbor, and she gets her photo-card back. It's just unbelievable. In my case also it was a miracle. And here such coincidences! That's all about the evacuation. The rest were sent away to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. You can't imagine what happened at those times at the railroad stations when the people were being sent to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. They were all so packed together, children, old women and men, all in the same railroad car, without space even to stand, and the whole thing was going on in such an unusual way. They didn't get any food; it was summer still. It was the tenth month.</span>

It was only then that we recognized how many were missing. Because until then they took them a few at a time, a few people. Although if one would have added it up, it would have made quite a large number. It is the same in case of a person. When one lives with him together one doesn't notice how he develops. If you see a person after ten years' absence you hardly recognize him. One sees the difference, the tremendous difference. And so it was there. All at once we noticed the difference. How many were missing! And only young people were around, because all the old ones had been sent away. The mood was terrible. And we somehow felt that things won't last long. One saw that everything goes to naught. We just lived on. Up to then people were still trying to look kind of properly dressed, one would take care of his clothes, but from then on all the desire disappeared. One would go to work because one had to do so. People worked and people were trading because they had to live, they had to eat. But there was no special interest for it. And I already told you what happened afterwards. I was finally taken . . .

The girls lived on the ground floor and first floor. We lived on the second and third floor. We were not permitted to see the girls. One girl had there her boy friend, her betrothed, and you know that in such a case, people take chances. She took a chance. She went upstairs and the Lagerfuhrer caught her. And now I want to tell you about the sadism of that man. He did not care that it was a woman, a young girl, and he beat her until he beat out her eyes with a whip and that is the first time in my life that I saw such a beating.

But I later found out that there were many steps beyond that, so many that one simply can't imagine. Well, some other details how things happened. One was hungry and the food was not always eatable. In time one got accustomed. One would see to it that one got a second plate of soup, even if one would take a chance to get slapped in the face. It was the food that mattered. We were there seven days. Under these very bad conditions, we spent seven days. Then there came, well, we were told that one hundred twenty-nine persons are to go to <a class="placename" href="#vothC71" type="camp">Markstadt</a>, a work camp <a class="placename" href="#vothC71" type="camp">Markstadt</a>. If you want to know where <a class="placename" href="#vothC71" type="camp">Markstadt</a> is, well, it is near <a class="placename" href="#vothL313">Breslau</a>. Near <a class="placename" href="#vothL313">Breslau</a> they were building a plant for Krupp. They were erecting shops. There were already two thousand Jews when I arrived. A lot more workers were needed. The work had started and they needed a lot of workers; and the Poles were already all taken so they had to take the Jews. One hundred twenty-nine people of us were sent over there, among them twenty-nine women. These women were mostly the ones who had somebody among the men. That is, they were married, or they were engaged, or they had good friends among them. There were several hundred women, but these had arrived at other times. This time twenty-nine women came. Almost all of them had some relatives among the men. That time we still traveled in passenger cars. We arrived at <a class="placename" href="#vothC71" type="camp">Markstadt</a>. It was already winter. It was cold. When we arrived there we saw nothing. We came the square and there comes the chief of the guard. The chief of the guard didn't look in any way terrible, we were already accustomed to these uniforms, but here comes a man with a leather jacket. And he spoke in a firm voice, a voice of command. He spoke German. And here I noticed a Jewish star. I understood that he was a Jew. He didn't make any special speech, but he immediately called around the pushers, the Jewish <a class="term" href="#vothG_capo">capos</a> who were appointed, and told them to which barracks they should go.</span>

In that <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> they marched four abreast. Until then, from the railroad station to the square we marched five abreast. And when they ordered us to step forward, we didn't know the customary orders of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> so we stepped forward in fives. There were among us three brothers and they wanted to stand together so that they could sleep together. But since they stepped forward in fives, so it came out that every fifth person had to step aside. And so it was the lot of one of these brothers that he was separated from the other two. He wasn't yet accustomed to the fact that one cannot contradict a <a class="term" href="#vothG_capo">capo</a>. And he hit him, but real hard.</span>

The floggers were Jews, and possibly when all this conversation would be later listened to, people will think that I am contradicting myself, because once I talk bad about the Germans and the next time I talk well of them, and then again I speak bad about the Jews. But I am telling the truth and I am giving the various details. It was sad to see a German put himself in our place, and have more understanding for us than the so-called "brother-man." I don't want to go further into that subject. I want to tell how things occurred in that <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, and the main thing that happened to me. Thus, the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> was located as I told you already in <a class="placename" href="#vothC71" type="camp">Markstadt</a>, in a locality surrounded by barracks around and around, a place of approximately ten thousand kilometers square this apparently is a slip of tongue and should possibly mean ten thousand square meters. We were behind wire, guarded by the German <a class="term" href="#vothG_wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>. In those times we were still guarded by the Germans <a class="term" href="#vothG_wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>, and round and round were also barracks of civilian laborers such as Poles, Czechs, Frenchmen and also Germans. That is, from all possible regions of Europe they imported people to work there. We were exactly in the center. In the morning when they could wake us‚Äîand we were waked at about five‚Äîthe <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a> would take place; but I didn't yet know what an "<a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>" was. All I knew, I was waked early in the morning, it was completely dark because it was winter, and we were told that as soon as we hear three whistles, that is, when they whistled three times, we should present ourselves for the <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>. What <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>? How <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>? I didn't know. I only knew that we had to appear. Each word they were speaking to us would give me such a fright, that out of fright I didn't know what I really should do. Because it is always that way. When one first comes there, one is not accustomed to it. It does something to a person. He doesn't know in what kind of a world he really is. And so we stepped forward for <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>. We were counted. Well, then I understood that <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a> means, when people line up and are being counted. They check whether anybody is missing. And we went back, we were told that at nine o'clock everybody has to be in the barracks because they will call for us. Until nine we were in the room, at nine there came the pushers. They belonged to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> management who always stayed home; some were from the night shift, because there were pushers for the people who worked nights, and slept in the daytime. But when the pushers heard that a new transport had arrived, they wanted to know what kind of people they were. There were people who lived also near us at home and they might have known some of the people.</span>

When we marched across the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, here and there one would get beaten, according to custom. In general, whenever a new transport arrived, I found out later, it was customary to beat them, and they were told all kinds of things so that they should be penetrated by terror. We were led into the washroom. When we arrived in the washroom there were sitting two barbers, ready with their machines and there comes in a man with a whip in his hand, beautiful boots, a good jacket, dressed warm and beautiful.</span>

We were bathed, we were led fifty people at a time into a small bathing room. At the most, under normal conditions, say like in the army where they bathe together, there could have entered ten, fifteen people. But we were shoved in fifty at a time. Our things we had to leave outside and we, ready, (without even a towel, we were not permitted to dry ourselves) we had to get out an dress quickly and go to . . . Well, excuse me, I have forgotten. Before we had to pass through the barber. The barber sheared off all our hair and after that we went into the bath. We were led again home, into the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">blocks</a>. We were told there will be again an <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>, a special one for us, that is, we will be called to fetch our food cards. In this <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> there was a rule that every one of the inmates was given a monthly food card on which he could get his dinner. He had the dates on it from the first to the thirtieth according to the month, every day the date was punched out. And if one would lose such a card, he would eat no dinner. We got there, if I remember, exactly the 25th of February.</span>

We stood in line waiting for our cards, but the question was not about cards. They were taking down what one is, where one is from, what kind of trade one has, and so on. It lasted for hours. They called out the names, and finally we got our cards, went to the counter, and fetched our dinner. When I stood in line for my dinner I saw a sick-waiter. There was an infirmary and the infirmary had some male nurses [side-waiters]. There were two kinds of sick-waiters, one kind who were stationed in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, and others at the construction plant. This one was a <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> sick-waiter who always stayed home, treated the sick on the "<a class="term" href="#vothG_revier">revier</a>" [ward].

            <span class="utterance" who="kimmelmannA" start="x" end="x">Well, like in Polish, to make it ironical. I saw him carrying a large dish. This dish was about a liter and a half in size and he carried such a dish packed full. Well, here is what I saw: red turnips I saw, potatoes with their peelings and rotten, and something else red. And I thought, I saw there some dogs, I thought he carried it for the dogs. I couldn't imagine that it was food for humans. But when I came to the dispense window, I was immediately convinced that that was cooked for me. You know people in general did not eat well during the war, it was so even when I was home. But still, one isn't accustomed to such things. One cannot get immediately accustomed to such food. If one isn't starved for a long time, and one is just simply hungry, one cannot eat just everything. At that time I couldn't imagine that I would ever get accustomed to such kind of fare. But afterwards I learned that it is dinner to the barrack hall and we see dozens of prisoners, inmates of the camp, trudging towards our hall. We didn't know why. Soon we had a chance to find out for ourselves. They knew (they were already a year in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>), they knew that all the transports..that when one is worried one cannot take to such food. They knew that we won't eat our rations. And so they waited for it. You may ask how there happened to be people during the day in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>? What were they doing there? Well, I have already told you that there were sections that worked at night. When they heard that a transport had arrived, it was for them the greatest event. Because then they could at least gorge themselves to a fill. And then there were some sections that worked inside the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> in the barracks and so on. There was always a need for workers in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. Such people had the good fortune to come to us and to eat our dinner. They didn't know how to thank us. And that did again something to me. I asked myself, what in reality is man?</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="kimmelmannA" start="x" end="x">I was that time fourteen years old. A human being, who before the war sure was a human being whether he was a bit poor or not, for example, the average man, how is he today? He doesn't look that the potatoes are rotten, whether they stink, whether the food is hard or soft. He takes it, he waits for it. They simply fight each other for the food. When two were waiting or watching one person, till he shoved away his plate, both of them would throw themselves at it. Sometimes the plate would break, and nobody had anything. So that's how it was. It was the first day, and I just prayed to get again to work. Only not to have to remain in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>; I shouldn't have to look at all this. I thought maybe on the job things will be better. Well, we managed to live through the day, we imagined the worst things, we discussed various matters, like when one is new in a <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. In the evening there is <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>. And it meant <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a> for the new transport. What was going on? Well, we will be assigned to the various firms. Tomorrow when we shall have to go to work, we shall know when to step forward, where to go. They arranged it in this way. They had made already a list and they were calling [the roll]. It could not take a second to say yes or here. And as I have told you already, we were a hundred twenty-nine. When we stepped forward and the <a class="term" href="#vothG_trusty">trusty</a> counted, all at once there is one missing. There were twenty-nine women, and twenty-nine women were exempt as they were assigned to the personnel of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>; for the kitchen, and for the laundry. As personnel of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, they did not go to the shops. And there had to be one hundred of us but one man was missing. I didn't know yet the order of this <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. I have seen that the <a class="term" href="#vothG_trusty">trusty</a>, that is the leader of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> who was also a Jew, I told you already about the fellow who was wearing the leather coat when we arrived . . .</span>

But I saw that here is a man who was maintaining discipline, and demanded that everything be just so. I saw already that he is getting excited so he said . . . well, he called immediately the pushers, the pushers were two whistles, and when they whistled twice it meant they were calling the pusher, the division heads. I didn't take five minutes, imagine a large square where there were about three thousand people. It didn't take five minutes, everybody was assembled and stood like one man.</span>

In our place there were no <a class="term" href="#vothG_capo">capos</a>, only division elders or pusher. The there were also group leaders. There were various categories. A division elder, for instance, was the superior of a group that worked in one firm. Then there were group leaders. These group leaders were subordinated to the pushers. One has to say that the division elder was responsible for all the Jews in his division. On the other hand the group leader could already shift his responsibility to the division elder. He had less responsibility to the division elder. This isn't especially important.</span>

Immediately, a command was given that it should not take more then five minutes for that man to appear. It didn't take a second and the pushers all disappeared. And it didn't take five minutes and the man was caught. What happened to that man? Among those twenty-nine women there was his wife among them. His wife and his sister-in-law, that is, the sister of his wife. He went over there for a moment to the barracks, she didn't work that time, it was still the first day, he didn't work yet the first day, so he went over to his wife and they sat there a bit, and he naturally didn't hear that <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a> was taking place. And so he sat at his wife's and they were talking. He didn't think of anything and never could imagine what was in store for him. So when they came he only asked him in the dirtiest language which I heard then practically for the first time; in Jewish he asked him, and he said . . .</span>

He asked him where he was, so he replied at his wife's, that he hadn't heard the call. A man still thought that that may be an excuse, because till then one was still accustomed to find an excuse. From then on we had to get accustomed unfortunately to something else, that is, that one immediately was to expect something, some kind of thrashing. There wasn't much of a debate. A stool was brought, they made him take off his pants. Two men held him, and then another kat, his name was Moshe Nachtinger, that was, of course, what did you call it before‚Äîa false name?</span>

The first time in my life have I seen such a beating. His pants pulled down, a whip with a steel wire twisted along, it was about half a meter long so that when one would beat with it on the back it would wind itself down around the stomach, where it made large cuts. Can you imagine steel wire and covered with a piece of leather? It was then the first time in my life that I heard an older person, a grown-up person wail and cry, and ;lead in such a manner. That was for me something that I never have experienced and never expected. You can imagine what an impression it made on me, when I saw it for the first time. I . . . I . . . I then imagined different things. I had only one wish. I only wished then to get for five minutes the authority to avenge him. I was taken by such a rebellious mood, something was going on in my heart. What can one do? One has to keep his mouth shut, and see to it that one himself is not getting a beating.</span>

Each one had to work. And they would call such and such a name, he had to reply immediately "yes" or "here" and step over to the other side. We were already accustomed. We knew that in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> we are marching four abreast, that is, when we had to march we would march four in a row. In a moment it had to be done. One had to listen when his name was being called, run out from the line and get into another formation, and watch that there be only four in a row so that one should not happen to be the fifth, otherwise one would ge such a beating that he couldn't assigned, told the name of the firm, and then each division elderly was told that he should check up whether we knew that name of our firm. And he asked everybody. To many it didn't occur to remember. Nobody had such a great interest in it. So when one would have forgotten he would get "what was coming to him."</span>

Well, there was no arrangement that one day the potatoes were cooked with vegetables, and the next day with some different ingredients. He used the work "Eintopf". That was the famous German meal at the time of scarcity, so much propagandized by Goebbels which was supposed to combine all the food available into one pot. It was what they called the one pot meal devised to save labor and fuel. Here they cooked always the same thing. Of course, with three thousand people to feed you cannot be very choosy. Still one cannot talk it into himself, one cannot create for himself the illusion that there was something good about it.</span>

I mean, if one has been working, then consequences were such, that is, if one lived on the ration and worked for twelve hours on the job. Of course from home, one still had some muscle, [there he] still was fed and had strength. And so, first of all, one would ge thin and weak. The second consequence was that one would begin to swell, that is, first the feet, then the face, then the eyes, forming large bags under the eyes, and the third consequence was that one would go to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_revier">revier</a> [sick barracks] and die.

We had no time to eat, we would look around and see if the master doesn't look or maybe he is at the other end of the section, then one would take a piece of bread in his mouth. So we ate. It would not happen that we specially would sit down to eat. So things happened the first day. It went on up to midday. At noon we had a half an hour "lunch" time, but we didn't have anything to eat. Because the noon meal, the supposedly noon meal, we would get at night when we would return home and so a twelve o'clock we had nothing to eat. Now after the noontime there would come the Polier.

I mean if one has bread in the cupboard and one knows that he can at any time go there and cut off a slice and eat, so one doesn't crave it. One just eats it. When one wants to eat, one takes it, and precisely for that reason, that one can go to it whenever one wants to, one doesn't realize how good it is that one can cut himself a slice. But when one doesn't have it, then one notices it. And then one feels a much stronger hunger than a normal person, and second, if one is starved for a long time and one gets the food, one can eat it . . . One has as they say in Yiddish, "a gut without bottom." It just goes in there and one doesn't know where it goes. And when one is for a moment satiated, in five minutes one is hungry again.</span>

When we came to our plant each one who worked in the firm went to his foreman and had to stand at attention. The foreman would come out and look at us and look at us and then assign each one to his place. There were various plants, there were plants where they looked just for skilled labor. These people . . . of course their work, their situation was much better. Where one works at his own profession, at his own calling, the work is more interesting in comparison with doing just common labor in which one has absolutely no interest. In the broader sense, nobody had any interest to accomplish something for the Germans, but if one is already‚Äîif one has to do the work, one feels much better if his work is more interesting. Then, though, the divisions had mostly road labor, road work. If the division was large, more guard masters would come with us and the guards had to stand all day and watch over us. I worked for quite a long time for this firm in transport and road work, road construction, another time I was assigned to another firm, of which I will tell you more. I want to tell you yet how things would occur at work; then again about the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. We worked until 12 o'clock without any interruption, constantly being coaxed by the foreman and by the guard, listening to their yells; every mistake was immediately taken notice of and we simply were trembling at our shovel. At noon we had a half an hour; those who had such a strong will that they could have saved some bread would eat something at 12 o'clock while the others had to look on, and each one had the desire to tear out the bread from his mouth. With aching eyes they would look at the bread as I know for myself that when I had no bread for lunch, which happened often; for it was very seldom when I had some, but mostly I had none‚Äîto look only at those who were eating. Sometimes I would turn away; I couldn't look‚Äîlook on at the others eating. I was terribly hungry. At 12:30 we returned to work and worked again. During the day there would come various officers to check on the guard and at the same time they would also check up on us; and when they disliked somebody or in general to instill fear they would write down their names and a note would go to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> and punishment would be meted out by the Jewish executioner; by the so-called hangman; they had to mete out the punishment in the presence of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> <a class="term" href="#vothG_commandant">commandant</a>.</span>

I worked with a firm [the name does not come through clearly on the wire]; it was a firm that constructed railroad tracks and communications. It was very cold; one group was assigned to work in a ready built barracks when we arrived, they were there already about a year. I was assigned to a ready building where they worked on cannons. I had to repair the tracks, and I had on me a few cigarettes. So a Czech, a civilian, passed by and he asks me whether I got some cigarettes. They knew, already, that we had cigarettes. Sometimes we would get an allotment of cigarettes.</span>

I struggled to such an extent that both of them‚Äîthe two who held me‚ÄîI threw them to the floor. The stool from under my stomach . . . it slipped out and we all three fell. When I got my allotment, I couldn't get up any more. I had to get up because they continued beating me.

If one doesn't have the strength to run away immediately, one could get so many wallops that one just had to get out or one would remain lying there‚Äîthat's how it was. So they would let go of you after so and so many strokes. After the beating they would let you loose, but you couldn't get up; and you were more beaten and finally one would get up. I had to put on my pants, and I got out and came to my barracks; the people with whom I lived together put on cold compresses; the next morning they could see what I had on my body. They called it a map, there were lines, blue and black ones, and that formed a map. Returning again to the work conditions. After lunch we worked in the firm where I worked until 5 o'clock. At 5 o'clock we had to step forward and about 6 o'clock we were home again. They fetched our dinner. It was still good enough, modern, that we had bathrooms. One could go and bathe.</span>

Then it was when the real tragedy would start. After all, whether it was winter or it was cold, all night there had to be a night watch. There were 26 men in one room, so we arranged at every hour another one was holding watch. That amounted to about every third day to be on watch‚Äîabout every third day one had to take over the watch for one hour. It was only one hour but imagine that in the middle of one's sleep‚Äîand we really didn't have too much time for sleep‚Äîso one has to get up whether it is cold or not, with nothing to wear, to watch for an hour‚Äîsuch an hour‚Äîif you, yourself have not experienced it, it would be to demand too much that you could imagine yourself what it was.</span>

Then we got accustomed, one says, "Well, let them beat me," but one can't anymore, one doesn't have the strength [to clean up]; can't anymore; "I will get the beating but I am tired from work; I can't anymore." They would come in, two, three of them, and of course they would not look under every bed; they had no time for that; each one had to keep clean under his own bed. They would take a kind of sample and some nights they would not come in, but the fear was every night.

It does something to a person; I am telling you‚ÄîI can't describe it to you now,‚Äîbut that does something to a man and he becomes like paralyzed. It would happen at the start. They wanted to terrorize more the new ones and hit us indiscriminately; one was bleeding; the night was terrible.

Such a thing didn't exist; not a single hour; the best moment was for me before I had eaten because when I had my ration of bread in my pocket, in my knapsack‚Äîwe sewed ourselves some sacks‚Äîthat was the most happy moment for me, I knew I still have something to eat and when I want to eat, I have something to eat. But as soon as it was eaten, I had no hope any more. And so time passed.

If he loses his position he would go down just like the others and he was ready, rather, to kill a hundred others than to lose his position. The Germans, didn't have to bother with the whole <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> population at all; just appoint one Jew and then he would arrange everything in the best order to their satisfaction and very often, much beyond their demands. That was their basic principle in all camps. That was about how I told you in general about the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> life, from the time I went there. Sundays there was a special <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>, that is, the rooms had to be specially cleaned and the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> commander would go through Sunday every hall to see whether it was clean. So up to 12 noon we had no place in our rooms, whether it was cold or not we had to remain outside and when the rooms were cleaned, nobody could enter any more. Before 12 o'clock, that is, at 11:30 there was roll call. We stepped forward, were counted, counted again, again we were standing half an hour and we continued standing until the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> commander with the <a class="term" href="#vothG_trusty">trusties</a> and some other prominent people would go through the rooms. If they disliked something, they would say, such and such room remain standing. These either would get no dinner or they would have to exercise, exercises which do not lead to physical development but are to destroy a person. Punitive exercises were ordered‚Äîthat was our Sunday! There were a few hours in the afternoon we had to ourselves. When the personnel of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> themselves wanted to rest, they would leave us in peace. That was the only case‚ÄîSunday afternoon. Otherwise we never had peace. I am speaking now about [name of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> not recognizable‚Äîsee on previous record].</span>

Although I have seen the Jewish militia at home‚ÄîI have observed all the terrible things that they have done‚ÄîI never could imagine that one Jew could do such a thing to another Jew. But in time I became convinced . . . I don't know how to say it. I also cannot decide to say that these people were little conscious [had little understanding]. As I told you in the introduction, if I should imagine what I would have done in their place‚ÄîI have no answer‚ÄîI am by means sure today to say, "No, I would not have accepted such a position." A man is not responsible for what he is doing, but it is a fact that it had to be so.

People who were bandits still before the war and have been murdering before. And when we arrived and they heard that we were Jews, that a Jewish transport has arrived, so they had the best opportunity to show their morals and to deal with us just how they pleased, because they were given complete authority. And I was assigned to <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> 17. Here we had a Pole from the Ukraine. He was just a real bandit. Just a real criminal. And with dirty language, the only one he knew with his intelligence. And that wasn't all that he was hollering. But he started right away to beat us and it was just terrible. I wasn't beaten that time, but the others were beaten, and I was the same candidate, I could have been struck down just as well as the others . . . We brought our stools.</span>

So these stools we brought with us. [Apparently chairs and stools are used here interchangeably.] And so we [they??] said that we had to clean them. He gave us some paper. Very small pieces. With this small piece we had to clean up the whole stool, so that it should look exactly like new lumber. But [while] we were sitting there together cleaning he grabbed a chair from one and threw it and immediately he opened two heads. Blood was streaming. One could not go to the dispensary. One could not go out. It was the first night. One could not do a thing so what did one do? He took off his coat, wrapped it around his head until the blood was dried and went to sleep.

And that did not happen only in our <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>. As I heard later. But everywhere around. In our <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>.it was so. He was such a terrible man, and he did such bad things. When we were all exhausted and there was so much blood on the floor, so he ordered to wipe off the blood, to clean up the floor, and to line up in rows inside the room and so we had to stand all night. He chose an assistant by name . . . he was a deputy <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> leader and they slept in shifts. One two hours, the other two hours, and they stood guard over us so that nobody should sit down. And when he would discover that somebody sat down, such one isn't seeing any m ore the sunrise. Obviously one didn't sit down. We stood all night and just shortly about a half an hour before the <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>, that it was before 5 o'clock he ordered us quickly to lie down on our beds and we barely had time to lie down when the call came for <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>. We went out for <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>. They took away our overcoats. It was cold. And all our coats, our civilian coats were still reasonably thick. We had them yet from home. All that was taken away. Some were running around just in bars shirts and so we got out to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>. About these things there is nothing to tell. Everybody has experienced cold and everybody can imagine it, what it is being cold. And so we were standing there for an hour, sometimes two. In general, in the beginning before we were assigned to work, we stood much longer. They ordered us then to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">blocks</a>. When we came to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">blocks</a>. we got breakfast. Well, the breakfast was better than in the Jewish <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. Because here we got hot soup, gritz soup in the morning, and that we would not get in the Jewish <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. After the soup we had to clean up the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>, that is, make the beds. The beds had to be so level, like a table, just like this desk. So level had they to be. And when something was just not so the person was given some experience! When it was reported that the beds are ready he would come in and when he couldn't find anything [wrong] he ordered all from the sleeping room . . . You see the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> was divided into three parts, the eating room and from both sides sleeping rooms. At the start each one of us had a bed to himself. Each one slept in his own bed, a blanket; in spite of the fact that it was winter it was very cold and the beds had to be in the best order. And when he wouldn't find any thing, each one had his bed in good order, he would chase us out all from the sleeping room, then would do something to a bed, then he would call us back, "Look what kind of beds you make." Although we knew that he did it. One couldn't say a thing. And from that all suffered. They were beating us so and they were not beating us just because they wanted to. And I wonder why did he have to play such dirt. He could just simply go at somebody and beat him. Nobody could defend himself, and when, thank God, we were done with the beds, we had to start to scrape the lockers. [That previous sentence about the beating isn't exactly clear but that is how it is on the record. Abe was at times a bit emotional and what I noticed happened is the negatives or no's would disappear from the sentence or sometimes unnecessary negatives would be put in.] We had to stand there all day. A <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> would be all clean, we had to stand.</span>

And then he said thus,‚Äîwe had brought with us various eating utensils from the Jewish <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, so he threw it all out on the garbage heap and said thus‚Äî"When you go to work you have to organize dishes, you must organize, paint the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>. You have to organize everything." But then I didn't know yet what it means organize. Well, it simply meant that we had to steal it. The <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> leader demanded from us that we should steal at the construction works, and when we were caught at the construction works, then they would come to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> leader and he would beat us for it. So you can imagine in what situation we were. And so it was at the beginning. We were beaten in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">blocks</a> for that what we would not bring, and we were beaten for bringing things. Whatever one did he was beaten for it. And I want to tell an episode which made a great impression on me, and in particular a good impression. There were in our <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> a father and a son. The father was already fifty years old and I don't know how he got to <a class="placename" href="#vothC30" type="camp">Funf Teichen</a>. He was already a bit swollen. [The expression swelling or swollen was a general term for conditions that would arouse the suspicion of the camp authorities that a person was hopelessly sick. As a rule people with swollen feet or swollen joints were assigned immediately for destruction.] And he had a son who was very strong. While in the Jewish <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> he worked in a good plant and he knew how to take care of himself. Otherwise he worked around the Czech barracks and at the beginning, the Czechs had a lot to eat so they would throw away some moldy bread on the garbage heap and from that a person could nourish himself well. (*This is not an exaggeration). [The access to garbage heaps near kitchens or military barracks of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> was considered a very lucky break and saved many a person from a death from starvation.] One was lucky when one could find such things. So he was sufficiently strong. And the father because he was old and couldn't move so fast would always fall the first victim. He was beaten so badly that he really couldn't take it any more. And on that day that the father got the first beating and the son couldn't stand it any more. Somehow he got up courage, and he stepped forward when he approached the father to strike him again. He said, "Mr. <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">Block</a> Leader, why do you beat my father?" And as soon as he heard it he raised his club but he didn't strike him yet, and he said, "What, you dare to ask me such a question? You know that I have the say over the life of the father, and your life, and over the life of the life of these 150 cursed Jews; and that I can do what I please. You dare to tell me something?" So he said, " Mr. <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">Block</a> Leader, you may beat me as much as you like, I won't say a thing and I won't cry, but let my father alone." And I don't know how it made an impression on him, but he did not touch the father any more. On the contrary he gave him more soup and he gave the son an assignment inside the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> and he could always scrub the floors and he would get more to eat. Of course, one can't say that if everyone would have done that, he would get away with it, because many certainly acted in a similar manner and were killed for it. Such things were not tolerated in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. Because there wasn't so much decency, but this one got away with it and it made on me a very good impression. Of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>, of the 170 men where I was, became less and less every day, many went to sick quarters, many did not return, many died, and then there again started the . . .</span>

When they were beating us, and beating us so much, and with little food, one just doesn't have the strength to work. And when we would come to work we simply would fall asleep on the job. When one doesn't sleep one has to sleep. The foreman had understanding. At first they were beating us, saying you don't accomplish anything. People simply slept. They made a report to the construction authorities.</span>

So an order was issued by the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> commander that at 9:00 everybody must be in bed and no more beating.

And again we went to work next morning and we slept again and we reported it so there came an order that he shouldn't do that either and we should be able to go to sleep at nine o'clock.

And they complained that we don't keep any more order, that we let dirt lay around and so on; and on the other hand it is demanded from them that there be order in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">blocks</a>, so they arranged it that beating was again permitted, but not killing. Only dry blows that there be no marks afterwards. Well, the beating was permitted again, so he prepared right away at the door two clubs, so when we arrived the first two he immediately stretched over a chair and beat them. And so in three months we didn't see anything else but beatings, killings, again killings, nothing to eat, and hard work. The morning <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appells</a> were something terrible. We stepped forward daily for <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>. For the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> <a class="term" href="#vothG_trusty">trusties</a> we stepped forward by <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">blocks</a>. And after roll call we stepped forward in working platoons. That is, those who worked in the same plant stepped forward together. We marched outward in division of 100, for every hundred men there was one responsible that they should march straight, and that they behaved decently on the street. So they arranged us in three files. We were at that time 1800 men so we were 600 in each file. If they would have done it in a proper fashion, if order would have really been their aim, we would have marched from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> according to assignment; we were there in groups of 600 men. But they simply ordered "working divisions forward" and each one started running and stepped in wherever he happened to do so, because everybody wanted to get in the first row. If a large division walks, of 800 men, and they don't march in military formation, in orderly steps so it results, if one marches a little bit slower those behind are being retarded. If those in front walk a little bit faster then it comes out that rows and rows fall behind; they have to start running, and so we were already fatigued entirely before we arrived at the plant, so it was best to walk into the shops with the first hundred. Everyone pushed forward to get into the shops first. There was no order that that is what they wanted because if there was no order they had a job to do, they could beat us. So everyday there were found dead ones, they would not arrive to work because they were simply killed. It was going on so, the first three months, that during the first three months they have taken from us 800 men to the crematory</span>

When people live together, and for some time we have worked at different construction jobs, so we made acquaintance with the foremen and started trading again. In this <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> it was better in that respect that we were getting more cigarettes. And that was in such a matter, good workers would get more[??]. Each one according to his work and it also depended upon the foreman from whom we would get some premium coupons, worth a mark or two and for these there was a canteen and he could buy for them cigarettes. Well, these cigarettes one could peddle forward, and it went so far that some did real business with the foreman and they would get premium coupons worth several hundred marks and for them they could get a lot of cigarettes, and they would give the cigarettes to the foreman and the foreman would give them chocolate in exchange, or alcohol and that they would bring to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> and give it to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> leaders, and so they would make friends with them.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="kimmelmannA" start="12020.356" end="x">No, the foreman was not a prisoner. He was just a civilian. And so they would get together with the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> leaders and they started to get together and live together with the Jews. The Jews were useful to them, they gave them good things, and so a time came that nearly a half of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> <a class="term" href="#vothG_trusty">trusties</a> were Jews and in the kitchen and the majority were Jews and the office nearly the whole personnel were Jews. The Jews almost took over the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, and it became for the whole <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> much easier. We weren't threatened any more so badly. We weren't any more under constant danger. Oh yes, they would beat people because the Jewish <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> <a class="term" href="#vothG_trusty">trusties</a> would also beat people. But one was beaten not specially as a Jew. Do you understand? We were beaten and one would see that in some way one submits to the discipline although it was impossible, but at least a certain amount of beatings were omitted. One could manage to avoid them. And so I was there until 1944. In 1944, when at that time I also started some trading, I also got bonus coupons because I worked well, I told you about it before, and the foreman started to like me a bit, sometimes they would give me a bit of bread, and they started to give me premium coupons.</span>

And it was already known that when somebody would be brought back during the day to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, I am still talking about the Jew <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, one knew that it was from the firm Hellgolder. Well, I got accustomed to the work. I can say I had luck. I got accustomed to run over the roofs. We were not permitted to run on the sheets but we had to run on the planks, that is, on the wooden planks that were laid. They were about 30 centimeters thick and on these we could step. I got accustomed to it and for two years I worked for the same firm. I was very much liked there and at the end I got a lot of premium coupons, I would buy for them cigarettes, in the canteen, and sometimes I would buy for it bread and sell the bread again in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> for more, and so I would earn something. And so I managed to get a hold of some marks because in this <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> money had value, because many civilians worked in the plant, and they could make use of the money. That's how we could say that business became big. We and people were trading. And finally it came to that I have earned 100 marks, And these 100 marks I gave to an acquaintance who worked in the kitchen, that he should intervene with the chief of the kitchen so that he should take me in as kitchen help. That meant that evenings when I would come home from work I would go there to work. [Here is a break. As far as I remember the interview, it meant that by getting work in the kitchen after a full day's work in the plant one could get more liberal quantities of food and also eat the leftovers.] And the enemy was very near us and we had to evacuate. That was in January, 1945. It would be of no value to tell about the individual cases where one was beaten again. I have given you already some inside how things were going on at this <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. To sum up at the end it was reasonably good for us. We got accustomed to minor things, and one could manage somehow. We learned to help ourselves in some manner. January there came the order to evacuate and this is the beginning of a new period. We were given for the journey 500 gms. of bread, a piece of sausage, each one took two blankets, and so we marched on. Whether one had shoes or not, nobody bothered about it. In the deepest snow we ran forward. We left on a Sunday afternoon at three o'clock under <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> guard, and we ran until two o'clock at night without sleep, but then the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> got tired so they drove us into a barn. A barn where hardly 500 men could crowd in, 500 men at the maximum. We were shoved in 2,500 people. We were altogether in a transport, 5000 people, so they put at our disposal two such barns. Well, you can imagine when we got up in the morning the dead were stapled like railroad ties. So they were stapled up and abandoned. And so we marched 5 miles and we didn't get anything more to eat, than that which was given to us for the journey, the 500 gms. of bread.</span>

And some people never got up any more on account of the terrible heat. But it was this way, there were no beds, no plank-beds, just a plain floor, but on a floor of about 25 meters length and 10 meters width, packed in 2000 men. So can you imagine how it was?

They haven't taken our names well. By that time we had no more names, we had just numbers and in the KaZet [the word KaZet stands for concentration camp] we were given numbers. My number was 247093.
