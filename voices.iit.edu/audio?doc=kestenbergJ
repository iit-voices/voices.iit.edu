So many Jews in Warsaw, because from all the little towns Jews came to Warsaw. From Lodz, from all other cities, Jews came to Warsaw. [They said,]&#39;This is impossible. The Jews have to be resettled.&#39; And so an order was given to the Jewish . . . Jewish Council in Warsaw that every day six thousand people have to be delivered for resettlement to the East. The Jewish Council . . . people didn&#39;t know yet at that time what was going on here, what the Germans are going to do with us. People thought that they are really going to resettle us to the East, so that there should be less people in Warsaw. And so the Jewish Council said that it will do it. After a few weeks it was seen that the people don&#39;t want to come [go] Everyone wants to remain at home. And so the Germans themselves began to grab on the streets . . .</p>

In the small lager were only people, those who worked very hard, no, worked not so hard, bit they sat [around], had little to eat, and so forth. We, the younger ones, were transferred to the large lager. I was in block number twenty-three. This was a special block, a Jew-block, The Germans called it. And there I was two months. I rested up before I went to work. All that, thanks to the Jewish prisoners who had arranged everything so well that we shouldn&#39;t have to go to work immediately, but we should be able to rest up for a couple of months. And so we had rested up for a time, and then we went to work. The work was not so hard. The work consisted only of a few bricks . . . to carry bricks, because they were building, the Germans were building there various bunkers and so forth. Kitchens they were building. And so it went on till the bombing. That means for the bombing there arrived . . . one . . . one day there arrived Anglo-American aircraft, and they bombed. That means they were probably so well informed, the Germans . . . eh . . . eh . . . the English aircraft, that they did not bomb the lager but they bombed everything round and round the lager.

We didn&#39;t know the meaning of the word liberated. Now suddenly the Americans arrived [and] liberated us.
