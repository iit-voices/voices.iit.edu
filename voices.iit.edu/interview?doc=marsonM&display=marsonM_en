Then, I spent some time recovering. And by the month of . . . by early June, then I returned to my station in the Mayenne county. As the German army progressed, I was moved away from this station, with the other men from the station of course, and we headed towards Brittany, where we were arrested on June 18th, to be precise. Later, I escaped in September 1940.

                    The right-wing government of unoccupied France after the country's defeat by the Germans in June 1940, named after the spa town of Vichy, France, where the national assembly was based under Prime Minister Pétain until liberation in 1944. Vichy France was that part of France not occupied by German troops until November 1942. Authoritarian and collaborationist, the Vichy regime cooperated with the Germans even after they had moved to the unoccupied zone in November 1942. It imprisoned some 135,000 people, interned another 70,000, deported some 76,000 Jews, and sent 650,000 French workers to Germany.
