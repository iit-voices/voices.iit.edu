Et alors, d&#195;s le 18 juin 1940, nous avons &#195;t&#195; forc&#195;s de parcourir la France du Nord au Sud et de l&#39;orient d&#39;arriver &#195; Marseille."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "246.488","u": "[In English] Bon.

And where did you go from Marseille? Tell me. [aside to someone else: &#34;It was a great pleasure and thank you very much.&#34;]"},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "295.917","u": "[In French] [conversation with interpreter] A Marseille, c&#39;&#195;tait en d&#195;cembre 1942, nous avons entendu un message &#195; la radio de Londres, message qui avait &#195;t&#195; convenu avec mon p&#195;re &#195; son d&#195;part: le canari est bien arriv&#195; et il attend ses petits. C&#39;&#195;tait le signal que nous attendions pour partir pour aller le rejoindre. En octobre 1943, nous avons pris le train pour Perpignan, et c&#39;est de l&#195; que nous passions faire toutes nos recherches et pr&#195;voir tous les embarras que nous aurions en traversant la fronti&#195;re. Et de la fin d&#39;octobre 1943 nous avons pris le train, sans les papiers qu&#39;il fallait pour traverser la zone interdite, longeant la fronti&#195;re espagnole. Et . . . mon fr&#195;re et moi avons cherch&#195; le passage dans diff&#195;rents petits villages qui se trouvaient sur des sommets."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "385.816","u": "Et votre m&#195;re?"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "387.485","u": "[In English] And where was your mother?"},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "389.395","u": "[In French] Et ma m&#195;re attendait &#195; Perpignan les r&#195;sultats de notre enqu&#195;te . . . Pour les enfants, il ne fallait pas de papiers sp&#195;ciaux pour entrer dans la zone interdite. Et nous avions tous les deux moins de dix-sept ans &#195; ce moment-l&#195; et nous pouvions passer assez facilement &#195; travers les haies de police allemande qui contr&#195;laient les papiers des autres personnes. Voyant que tout &#195;tait impossible devant le refus de tout le monde de nous aider, m&#195;mes des guides qui avaient &#195;t&#195; questionn&#195;s, sans id&#195;es totalement de voir seulement ce que nous pourrions faire, nous sommes retourn&#195;s &#195; Perpignan d&#195;cid&#195;s &#195; partir seuls, sans guide, avec l&#39;aide de personne. Mon fr&#195;re acheta une boussole et une carte d&#39;&#195;tat-major de la r&#195;gion, et vers midi, nous sommes partis de Perpignan, pour une petite ville qui s&#39;appelle Oss&#195;ja, situ&#195;e &#195; combien d&#39;altitude? situ&#195;e &#195; 1200 m&#195;tres d&#39;altitude. Nous n&#39;avions &#195;videmment r&#195;ussi &#195; avoir aucun papier permettant le passage de la zone interdite, et cependant, dans le village d&#39;Oss&#195;ja, nous &#195;tions d&#195;j&#195; dans la zone interdite. Par cons&#195;quent, &#195; tout contr&#195;le, les Allemands auraient pu d&#195;couvrir que nous n&#39;avions pas de papiers et nous emp&#195;cher d&#39;aller plus loin. Ceci ne s&#39;est pas pass&#195; heureusement, mais &#195; la sortie de la gare d&#39;Oss&#195;ja, nous avons remarqu&#195; qu&#39;il y avait deux agents allemands qui demandaient les papiers permettant l&#39;entr&#195;e en zone interdite. Nous sommes rest&#195;s quelques instants sur la voie, et lorsque nous avons vu les deux agents partir, nous avons franchi la gare, et nous sommes sortis. Nous avions laiss&#195; deux sacs de montagne assez lourds et une valise &#195; la consigne en vue de pouvoir plus librement faire nos recherches, nos derni&#195;res recherches et explorations du pays."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "574.139","u": "Et puis?"},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "575.085","u": "Et puis nous sommes partis d&#39;apr&#195;s . . . en suivant un trajet qui nous avait &#195;t&#195; vaguement indiqu&#195; par quelques personnes dans le petit village m&#195;me. L&#39;ascension commen&#195;a vers la fin de l&#39;apr&#195;s-midi, et la pluie tombait en faisant des mottes de gadoue. Nous &#195;tions enfonc&#195;s dans la boue, tra&#195;nants, glissants, nous n&#39;en pouvions plus et n&#39;avancions pas. [Question off mic from interpreter] On n&#39;osait pas sortir la carte d&#39;&#195;tat-major de peur de la tremper et de la perdre. De temps en temps nous regardions la boussole pour voir si nous &#195;tions dans la bonne direction, et nous entendions les chiens des policiers allemands. Nous ne savions pas s&#39;ils &#195;taient &#195; nos trousses ou aux trousses de quelqu&#39;un d&#39;autre, mais on se taisait pour nous faire rater. Mon fr&#195;re cependant nous exhortait et nous poussait comme il pouvait, car nous &#195;tions les deux plus fatigu&#195;s, ma m&#195;re et moi. Et enfin, c&#39;est lui qui remontait le moral du trio, et qui nous a toujours tenus dans la bonne voie avec sa boussole. A la sortie du village, nous avons vu une caserne allemande, qui . . . dans laquelle logeaient des douaniers, et nous avions vu un de leurs gros chiens policiers qui servent &#195; d&#195;pister les gens qui essayent de passer la fronti&#195;re. Enfin, apr&#195;s avoir march&#195; pendant environ 5 heures, nous sommes tomb&#195;s &#195; pic sur une voie de chemin de fer au fond d&#39;une vall&#195;e et nous avons aper&#195;u une petite gare tr&#195;s semblable &#195; nos gares fran&#195;aises, et nous nous demandions si nous &#195;tions d&#195;j&#195; en Espagne et non pas toujours en France. Il commen&#195;ait &#195; faire nuit, et nous n&#39;osions pas nous d&#195;couvrir et aller demander des renseignements, m&#195;me approcher de la gare. En descendant, nous sommes tomb&#195;s . . . comment s&#39;appelle? un remblai . . . sur un remblai et nous avons &#195;t&#195; oblig&#195;s de passer au dessous d&#39;un tunnel, de contourner la voie et nous sommes descendus enfin sur une route qui semblait une route d&#39;assez grande importance, malgr&#195; qu&#39;il n&#39;y ait pas beaucoup de circulation dessus. Enfin nous nous sommes approch&#195;s de la gare, et nous avons vu une inscription qui semblait bien ne pas &#195;tre fran&#195;aise. C&#39;&#195;tait [Filbas?], &#195;quivalent de [biffure?] en espagnol. Et puis peu &#195; peu nous nous approchions sans nous en douter de la gare et nous avons entendu des jeunes filles chanter. Elles ne chantaient pas en fran&#195;ais, mais en espagnol. Aussit&#195;t, nous nous sommes approch&#195;s. Elles sont mont&#195;es peut-&#195;tre un peu effray&#195;es chercher leur p&#195;re. Leur p&#195;re a tout de suite compris. Beaucoup de gens nous ont aid&#195;, nous ont essuy&#195; les pieds, nous ont donn&#195; &#195; manger dans cette petite gare. Et le lendemain matin - ils nous avaient &#195;videmment donn&#195; leurs lits pour passer la nuit&#226;le lendemain matin, nous sommes partis de tr&#195;s bonne heure pour gagner la province de Barcelone, qui nous avait-on dit &#195;tait moins dangereuse, et de l&#195;, on ne pouvait pas nous renvoyer en France. De l&#39;aube m&#195;me, nous avons march&#195; certainement toute la matin&#195;e, et une bonne partie de l&#39;apr&#195;s-midi, et nous allions prendre un car dans un petit village situ&#195; encore dans la montagne, lorsque nous avons vu deux carabineros habill&#195;s d&#39;uniformes kaki et entour&#195;s de ceintures jaunes, avec de bas chapeaux [? de cire]. Ils sont venus vers nous, nous demander les papiers d&#39;identit&#195;, documentation, et nous n&#39;avons &#195;videmment rien pu fournir. Ils nous ont fait monter dans un h&#195;tel qui avait &#195;t&#195; r&#195;quisitionn&#195; enti&#195;rement par eux, et l&#195; a commenc&#195; l&#39;interrogatoire, ainsi que la fouille. L&#39;interrogatoire s&#39;est prolong&#195; toute l&#39;apr&#195;s-midi. Ils posaient de temps en temps une question, nous ont pr&#195;sent&#195; quelques fiches, nous ont confisqu&#195;s tout ce que nous avions. On ramassait une part ou tout des choses qui &#195;taient rest&#195;es dans nos poches, et que nous avions essay&#195; en vain de cacher. Et enfin, le soir, on nous a apport&#195; un d&#195;ner tr&#195;s copieux, avec . . . pour la somme modique de 25.000 francs qui avaient &#195;t&#195; confisqu&#195;s pendant l&#39;interrogatoire. La nuit, ils nous ont fait passer dans une chambre dont les fen&#195;tres avaient &#195;t&#195; grillag&#195;es, et avant de se coucher, ils nous ont enlev&#195; nos chaussures."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1023.643","u": "[In English] Were you all together?"},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "1025.974","u": "Yes, we were all together in the room."},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "1031.577","u": "[In French] Et alors, ils ont enlev&#195; nos chaussures, et le lendemain matin, ils ont frapp&#195;, ils nous ont r&#195;veill&#195;s, et ont de nouveau proc&#195;d&#195; &#195; un interrogatoire plus d&#195;taill&#195;."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1046.107","u": "[aside, unintelligible]"},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "1056.434","u": "Le surlendemain, nous avons &#195;t&#195; sortis de cette chambre et emmen&#195;s &#195; Barcelone au quartier g&#195;n&#195;ral de la police espagnole. Nous sommes rest&#195;s l&#195; pas m&#195;me cinq minutes. Nous avons &#195;t&#195; ramen&#195;s au poste de police, puis de nouveau &#195; l&#39;h&#195;tel o&#195; nous avions pass&#195; les deux nuits pr&#195;c&#195;dentes, et enfin, deux carabineros nous ont emmen&#195;s en prison &#195; Barcelone. L&#195;, bref interrogatoire, et puis nous avons &#195;t&#195; jet&#195;s en prison, un peu comme des b&#195;tes, dans de grandes cages dans les sous-sols de la pr&#195;fecture de Barcelone. Le surlendemain, nous sommes sortis miraculeusement et avons r&#195;ussi &#195; faire partie d&#39;un convoi qui devait gagner l&#39;Afrique du nord, et nous mener enfin en terre libre. Nous avons atteint Casablanca au bout de deux jours et enfin nous avons su sur le bateau qui nous menait &#195; Casablanca que mon p&#195;re &#195;tait &#195; Alger.

The first thing I saw in the morning when I woke up was busloads of troops who were going to the front through the north near Sedan and everyone was panicked, huddling around the radio."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "174.273","u": "[In English] Now tell me.

And so, starting on June 18, 1940, we were forced to travel throughout France, from the North to the South and the East, to arrive in Marseille."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "246.488","u": "[In French] Good. Who was with you in Marseille?"},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "252.163","u": "[In English] My grandfather, my mother and my brother."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "258.229","u": "And where was your father?"},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "262.175","u": "He was at the war."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "263.440","u": "Your father was in the war.

And where did you go from Marseille? Tell me. [aside to someone else: &#34;It was a great pleasure and thank you very much.&#34;]"},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "295.917","u": "[In French] [conversation with interpreter] In Marseille, it was December, 1942, when we heard a radio message from London, a message that we had arranged with my father at the time of his departure: The canary has arrived safe and sound and he&#39;s waiting for his little ones. This was the signal that we were waiting for, in order to go and be reunited with him. In October 1943, we took the train to Perpignan, and from there we did all our research and preparations for all the difficulties we would have in crossing the border. And at the end of October, 1943, we took the train, without the papers required to cross into the &#34;forbidden zone&#34; along the Spanish border. And . . . my brother and I looked for a way through various little villages up in the mountains."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "385.816","u": "[In French] And your mother?"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "387.485","u": "[In English] And where was your mother?"},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "389.395","u": "[In French] And my mother was waiting in Perpignan for the results of our investigation. Children didn&#39;t need special papers to enter the forbidden zone. And we were both under the age of 17 at the time and we could cross the German police barriers fairly easily where they were checking other person&#39;s papers. When we saw how impossible it was, since everyone refused to help us, even the guides who had been questioned were totally without any ideas as to what we could do, we returned to Perpignan, having decided to go it alone, without a guide, with no one&#39;s help. My brother bought a compass and an administrative road map of the area, and around noon, we left Perpignan for a small town called Osseja, located at.. what was the altitude? Located at 1200 meters above sea level. We had of course not succeeded in obtaining any papers giving us permission to be in the forbidden zone, and nevertheless, in the village of Osseja, we were already in the forbidden zone. Consequently, at any checkpoint, the Germans could have discovered that we were without papers and stop us from going any further. This didn&#39;t happen, fortunately, but coming out of the train station at Osseja, we saw two German agents who were checking papers for entrance into the forbidden zone. We stayed a few moments near the train tracks, and when we saw the two agents leave, we crossed through the train station and came out. We left behind two rather heavy backpacks and a suitcase, at the luggage checkroom, so that we would be less encumbered to look around, take a last look and explore the area."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "574.139","u": "And then?"},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "575.085","u": "And then we left . . . following a route that was vaguely indicated to us by some people in that same little village. We started our climb towards the end of the afternoon, and the rain was falling, turning the ground into clumps of slush. We were sinking into the mud, dragging our feet, sliding. We were exhausted and not making any progress. [Question off mic from interpreter] We didn&#39;t dare take out the map, for fear it would become soaked and useless. From time to time, we looked at the compass to see if we were going in the right direction, and we would hear the German police dogs. We didn&#39;t know if they were tracking us or someone else, but we kept quiet so as to be missed by them. My brother, nevertheless, drove us on and pushed us as best as he could, because both my mother and I were more tired than he. Ultimately, he was the one who boosted the morale of the three of us, and who kept us on the right path with his compass. Coming out of the village, we saw a German barracks . . . where customs agents were housed, and we saw their big police dogs that were used to track people who tried to cross the border. Finally, after having walked for about 5 hours, we suddenly came upon train tracks at the bottom of a valley and we saw a little train station that looked very similar to our French train stations, and we wondered if we were already in Spain and not in France anymore. It was beginning to get dark and we didn&#39;t dare show ourselves and ask directions, or even approach the train station. Coming down from the mountain, we came up to a . . . what is that called? An embankment. An embankment, and we had to cross under a tunnel, to go around the tracks and we finally made our way down to a highway that seemed like a major road, despite the fact that there wasn&#39;t much traffic. Finally, we approached the train station and we saw some writing [an inscription] that didn&#39;t seem to be French. It was [Filbas?], the equivalent of [biffure?] in Spanish. And then, little by little, we cautiously approached the train station and we heard some girls singing. They were not singing in French, but in Spanish. They ran off, a bit frightened, to find their father. Their father understood right away. Many people helped us, wiped our feet, gave us something to eat in this little train station. And the next morning&#226;they obviously had given us their beds for the night&#226;the next morning, we left very early to go to the province of Barcelona, which we were told was less dangerous, and from there, we couldn&#39;t be sent back to France. Starting at dawn, we had most likely walked all morning and a good part of the afternoon, and we were going to take a bus in a little village which was still up in the mountains, when we saw two Carabineros [in Spanish: customs officers], dressed in khaki uniforms with yellow belts and [rain?] hats. They came towards us, to ask for identification, documentation [in Spanish?] and we obviously had none to give them. They made us go to a hotel, the whole hotel having been requisitioned by them, and that&#39;s where the interrogation began, and where we were frisked. The interrogation lasted all afternoon. They would ask a question from time to time, show us some papers, confiscated everything we had. They collected everything we had in our pockets that we had tried unsuccessfully to hide from them. And finally, in the evening, they brought us a very copious dinner . . . for the modest price of 25,000 Francs, which was what they confiscated from us during the interrogation. At night, they put us in a room with bars on the windows, and before going to bed, they took our shoes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1023.643","u": "[In English] Were you all together?"},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "1025.974","u": "Yes, we were all together in the room."},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "1031.577","u": "[In French] And so, they took our shoes, and the next morning, they knocked and woke us up and proceeded with a more detailed interrogation."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1046.107","u": "[aside, unintelligible]"},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "1056.434","u": "[In French] The next day, we were taken out of this room and sent to Barcelona to the headquarters of the Spanish police. We didn&#39;t even stay five minutes. We were taken to the police station, then again to the hotel where we had spent the previous two nights and finally, two carabineros took us to prison in Barcelona. There, we had another brief interrogation, and then we were thrown into jail, a little like animals, in big cages in the basement of the Barcelona Prefecture. The next day, miraculously, we got out and managed to join a convoy going to North Africa and to finally take us into the free zone. We reached Casablanca after two days, and we finally learned on the boat to Casablanca that my father was in Algiers. And so, by the end of the week, once we got past the difficulties of the journey from Casablanca to Algiers, we were reunited with my father."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1174.660","u": "[In English] Well, were you afraid during this whole trip?"},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "1179.600","u": "A little bit, yes, but I really didn&#39;t know the danger we could . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1185.594","u": ". . . that you were in."},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "1186.889","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1187.462","u": "You didn&#39;t know the danger."},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "1189.040","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1189.643","u": "What were you afraid of?"},    {"who": "Jean Kahn", "start": "1192.547","u": "Of being arrested by the Germans, in the mountains."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1197.830","u": "Yes.

Pour les enfants, il ne fallait pas de papiers sp&#195;ciaux pour entrer dans la zone interdite. Et nous avions tous les deux moins de dix-sept ans &#195; ce moment-l&#195; et nous pouvions passer assez facilement &#195; travers les haies de police allemande qui contr&#195;laient les papiers des autres personnes. Voyant que tout &#195;tait impossible devant le refus de tout le monde de nous aider, m&#195;mes des guides qui avaient &#195;t&#195; questionn&#195;s, sans id&#195;es totalement de voir seulement ce que nous pourrions faire, nous sommes retourn&#195;s &#195; Perpignan d&#195;cid&#195;s &#195; partir seuls, sans guide, avec l&#39;aide de personne. Mon fr&#195;re acheta une boussole et une carte d&#39;&#195;tat-major de la r&#195;gion, et vers midi, nous sommes partis de Perpignan, pour une petite ville qui s&#39;appelle Oss&#195;ja, situ&#195;e &#195; combien d&#39;altitude? situ&#195;e &#195; 1200 m&#195;tres d&#39;altitude.

Ceci ne s&#39;est pas pass&#195; heureusement, mais &#195; la sortie de la gare d&#39;Oss&#195;ja, nous avons remarqu&#195; qu&#39;il y avait deux agents allemands qui demandaient les papiers permettant l&#39;entr&#195;e en zone interdite. Nous sommes rest&#195;s quelques instants sur la voie, et lorsque nous avons vu les deux agents partir, nous avons franchi la gare, et nous sommes sortis.

L&#39;ascension commen&#195;a vers la fin de l&#39;apr&#195;s-midi, et la pluie tombait en faisant des mottes de gadoue. Nous &#195;tions enfonc&#195;s dans la boue, tra&#195;nants, glissants, nous n&#39;en pouvions plus et n&#39;avancions pas. [Question off mic from interpreter] On n&#39;osait pas sortir la carte d&#39;&#195;tat-major de peur de la tremper et de la perdre. De temps en temps nous regardions la boussole pour voir si nous &#195;tions dans la bonne direction, et nous entendions les chiens des policiers allemands. Nous ne savions pas s&#39;ils &#195;taient &#195; nos trousses ou aux trousses de quelqu&#39;un d&#39;autre, mais on se taisait pour nous faire rater. Mon fr&#195;re cependant nous exhortait et nous poussait comme il pouvait, car nous &#195;tions les deux plus fatigu&#195;s, ma m&#195;re et moi. Et enfin, c&#39;est lui qui remontait le moral du trio, et qui nous a toujours tenus dans la bonne voie avec sa boussole. A la sortie du village, nous avons vu une caserne allemande, qui . . . dans laquelle logeaient des douaniers, et nous avions vu un de leurs gros chiens policiers qui servent &#195; d&#195;pister les gens qui essayent de passer la fronti&#195;re. Enfin, apr&#195;s avoir march&#195; pendant environ 5 heures, nous sommes tomb&#195;s &#195; pic sur une voie de chemin de fer au fond d&#39;une vall&#195;e et nous avons aper&#195;u une petite gare tr&#195;s semblable &#195; nos gares fran&#195;aises, et nous nous demandions si nous &#195;tions d&#195;j&#195; en Espagne et non pas toujours en France. Il commen&#195;ait &#195; faire nuit, et nous n&#39;osions pas nous d&#195;couvrir et aller demander des renseignements, m&#195;me approcher de la gare. En descendant, nous sommes tomb&#195;s . . . comment s&#39;appelle? un remblai . . . sur un remblai et nous avons &#195;t&#195; oblig&#195;s de passer au dessous d&#39;un tunnel, de contourner la voie et nous sommes descendus enfin sur une route qui semblait une route d&#39;assez grande importance, malgr&#195; qu&#39;il n&#39;y ait pas beaucoup de circulation dessus. Enfin nous nous sommes approch&#195;s de la gare, et nous avons vu une inscription qui semblait bien ne pas &#195;tre fran&#195;aise. C&#39;&#195;tait [Filbas?], &#195;quivalent de [biffure?] en espagnol. Et puis peu &#195; peu nous nous approchions sans nous en douter de la gare et nous avons entendu des jeunes filles chanter. Elles ne chantaient pas en fran&#195;ais, mais en espagnol. Aussit&#195;t, nous nous sommes approch&#195;s. Elles sont mont&#195;es peut-&#195;tre un peu effray&#195;es chercher leur p&#195;re. Leur p&#195;re a tout de suite compris. Beaucoup de gens nous ont aid&#195;, nous ont essuy&#195; les pieds, nous ont donn&#195; &#195; manger dans cette petite gare. Et le lendemain matin - ils nous avaient &#195;videmment donn&#195; leurs lits pour passer la nuit&#226;le lendemain matin, nous sommes partis de tr&#195;s bonne heure pour gagner la province de Barcelone, qui nous avait-on dit &#195;tait moins dangereuse, et de l&#195;, on ne pouvait pas nous renvoyer en France. De l&#39;aube m&#195;me, nous avons march&#195; certainement toute la matin&#195;e, et une bonne partie de l&#39;apr&#195;s-midi, et nous allions prendre un car dans un petit village situ&#195; encore dans la montagne, lorsque nous avons vu deux carabineros habill&#195;s d&#39;uniformes kaki et entour&#195;s de ceintures jaunes, avec de bas chapeaux [? de cire]. Ils sont venus vers nous, nous demander les papiers d&#39;identit&#195;, documentation, et nous n&#39;avons &#195;videmment rien pu fournir. Ils nous ont fait monter dans un h&#195;tel qui avait &#195;t&#195; r&#195;quisitionn&#195; enti&#195;rement par eux, et l&#195; a commenc&#195; l&#39;interrogatoire, ainsi que la fouille. L&#39;interrogatoire s&#39;est prolong&#195; toute l&#39;apr&#195;s-midi. Ils posaient de temps en temps une question, nous ont pr&#195;sent&#195; quelques fiches, nous ont confisqu&#195;s tout ce que nous avions. On ramassait une part ou tout des choses qui &#195;taient rest&#195;es dans nos poches, et que nous avions essay&#195; en vain de cacher. Et enfin, le soir, on nous a apport&#195; un d&#195;ner tr&#195;s copieux, avec . . . pour la somme modique de 25.000 francs qui avaient &#195;t&#195; confisqu&#195;s pendant l&#39;interrogatoire. La nuit, ils nous ont fait passer dans une chambre dont les fen&#195;tres avaient &#195;t&#195; grillag&#195;es, et avant de se coucher, ils nous ont enlev&#195; nos chaussures.</p>

This was the signal that we were waiting for, in order to go and be reunited with him. In October 1943, we took the train to Perpignan, and from there we did all our research and preparations for all the difficulties we would have in crossing the border. And at the end of October, 1943, we took the train, without the papers required to cross into the &#34;forbidden zone&#34; along the Spanish border.

                    <p class="utterance">[In French] And my mother was waiting in Perpignan for the results of our investigation. Children didn&#39;t need special papers to enter the forbidden zone. And we were both under the age of 17 at the time and we could cross the German police barriers fairly easily where they were checking other person&#39;s papers. When we saw how impossible it was, since everyone refused to help us, even the guides who had been questioned were totally without any ideas as to what we could do, we returned to Perpignan, having decided to go it alone, without a guide, with no one&#39;s help. My brother bought a compass and an administrative road map of the area, and around noon, we left Perpignan for a small town called Osseja, located at.. what was the altitude? Located at 1200 meters above sea level. We had of course not succeeded in obtaining any papers giving us permission to be in the forbidden zone, and nevertheless, in the village of Osseja, we were already in the forbidden zone. Consequently, at any checkpoint, the Germans could have discovered that we were without papers and stop us from going any further. This didn&#39;t happen, fortunately, but coming out of the train station at Osseja, we saw two German agents who were checking papers for entrance into the forbidden zone. We stayed a few moments near the train tracks, and when we saw the two agents leave, we crossed through the train station and came out. We left behind two rather heavy backpacks and a suitcase, at the luggage checkroom, so that we would be less encumbered to look around, take a last look and explore the area.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">And then we left . . . following a route that was vaguely indicated to us by some people in that same little village. We started our climb towards the end of the afternoon, and the rain was falling, turning the ground into clumps of slush. We were sinking into the mud, dragging our feet, sliding. We were exhausted and not making any progress. [Question off mic from interpreter] We didn&#39;t dare take out the map, for fear it would become soaked and useless. From time to time, we looked at the compass to see if we were going in the right direction, and we would hear the German police dogs. We didn&#39;t know if they were tracking us or someone else, but we kept quiet so as to be missed by them. My brother, nevertheless, drove us on and pushed us as best as he could, because both my mother and I were more tired than he. Ultimately, he was the one who boosted the morale of the three of us, and who kept us on the right path with his compass. Coming out of the village, we saw a German barracks . . . where customs agents were housed, and we saw their big police dogs that were used to track people who tried to cross the border. Finally, after having walked for about 5 hours, we suddenly came upon train tracks at the bottom of a valley and we saw a little train station that looked very similar to our French train stations, and we wondered if we were already in Spain and not in France anymore. It was beginning to get dark and we didn&#39;t dare show ourselves and ask directions, or even approach the train station. Coming down from the mountain, we came up to a . . . what is that called? An embankment. An embankment, and we had to cross under a tunnel, to go around the tracks and we finally made our way down to a highway that seemed like a major road, despite the fact that there wasn&#39;t much traffic. Finally, we approached the train station and we saw some writing [an inscription] that didn&#39;t seem to be French. It was [Filbas?], the equivalent of [biffure?] in Spanish. And then, little by little, we cautiously approached the train station and we heard some girls singing. They were not singing in French, but in Spanish. They ran off, a bit frightened, to find their father. Their father understood right away. Many people helped us, wiped our feet, gave us something to eat in this little train station. And the next morning&#226;they obviously had given us their beds for the night&#226;the next morning, we left very early to go to the province of Barcelona, which we were told was less dangerous, and from there, we couldn&#39;t be sent back to France. Starting at dawn, we had most likely walked all morning and a good part of the afternoon, and we were going to take a bus in a little village which was still up in the mountains, when we saw two Carabineros [in Spanish: customs officers], dressed in khaki uniforms with yellow belts and [rain?] hats. They came towards us, to ask for identification, documentation [in Spanish?] and we obviously had none to give them. They made us go to a hotel, the whole hotel having been requisitioned by them, and that&#39;s where the interrogation began, and where we were frisked. The interrogation lasted all afternoon. They would ask a question from time to time, show us some papers, confiscated everything we had. They collected everything we had in our pockets that we had tried unsuccessfully to hide from them. And finally, in the evening, they brought us a very copious dinner . . . for the modest price of 25,000 Francs, which was what they confiscated from us during the interrogation. At night, they put us in a room with bars on the windows, and before going to bed, they took our shoes.</p>

We were taken to the police station, then again to the hotel where we had spent the previous two nights and finally, two carabineros took us to prison in Barcelona. There, we had another brief interrogation, and then we were thrown into jail, a little like animals, in big cages in the basement of the Barcelona Prefecture. The next day, miraculously, we got out and managed to join a convoy going to North Africa and to finally take us into the free zone. We reached Casablanca after two days, and we finally learned on the boat to Casablanca that my father was in Algiers. And so, by the end of the week, once we got past the difficulties of the journey from Casablanca to Algiers, we were reunited with my father.</p>
