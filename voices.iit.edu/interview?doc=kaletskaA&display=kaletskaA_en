Together with us on the night of Friday- from Thursday to Friday it was- there happened to be with us my brother from Potianice and a child of my oldest sister, a grandchild twelve years old. At six o'clock in the morning the first bombs fell over <a class="placename" href="#vothL84">Kielce</a>. I went down with my parents into the cellar, but my father did not want to go. He said: "From this one cannot hide in the cellar." Then he "said" a chapter from the Psalms. My youngest brother was in the war on the Polish side. And with it I thought that the world had come to an end. To lose my youngest brother! I did not want to live any more. So naive I was then, to think that all I would lose in the war was my youngest brother. Once during the first days of September I got up especially early—five o'clock in the morning. There wasn't a single German to be seen on the street. So I said: "Mother, dear, maybe it was only a dream. Maybe they are really not here." Unfortunately, it was not a dream.. They were there, and they were there for a long time. My father had to leave his home to hide somewhere in the suburb. The <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> was looking for him. I remained alone with my mother in five rooms, and all through the night I was clinging to the window, running around in search. Where are the people who used to come every night- every evening- to see my father? Where are the grandchildren, who are afraid to cross the street and to come upstairs? Nobody was there.</span>

It was hard to bear. I was in my ninth month. We used to live like affluent citizens, my father-in-law, my man, and my sister-in-law. Now we were given a room of eight and one-half cubic meters,-- no, squares; I don't know how many cubic meters there were. And there I was to give birth to my child.

There were left in <a class="placename" href="#vothL7">Slonim</a> about two hundred Jews, out of a population of nine thousand Jews before the start of the slaughter, or possibly even more- I don't know.

There was a great <a class="placename" href="#vothL7">Slonim</a> rabbi, whose name I don't know. And these two hundred Jews had numbers hung on them (the Christians made them wear them), and they had to report every day to the square, an place of roll call, and they were sent to work. Work! We too had worries about work! The day my man was working, we had hope to survive that day. But when people came to the gates of the <a class="placename" href="#vothC38" type="camp">ghetto</a> and said, "no more work required," that was a dark day. We knew it was coming. November 1, 1942, the <a class="placename" href="#vothC38" type="camp">ghetto</a> was surrounded. Every few steps stood an armed German, with his gun ready, and at some distance on the hill machine guns. They told us nothing, but they took us "to work." We knew what that meant. And nearby were Russians, Poles; not all but many were waiting for what they could inherit from the Jews. Possibly they had waited so that in case the Germans themselves would not put an end to us, they could step in.</span>

That is what we were told from <a class="placename" href="#vothL508">Brest-Litovsk</a> and other Ukranian cities. And in Russia, as far as <a class="placename" href="#vothL294">Stalingrad</a> and the Ural [mountains], the Germans did it themselves. They could not relinquish the "sacred labor", and they had their mission. However, it did not start that day, nor later. With a sadistic forethought, they told us: "Have no care, this will become a labor <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, my word of honor." said Herr Ehrlich, the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> chief, to the Community Council. "Mass murder! Oh, no; that is out of the question- deportation, neither!! It will be converted into a work-<a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, no more loafing. And believe me, my word of honor." Believe his word of honor! In two weeks it started. First we saw them transporting the inhabitants of the smaller towns, from Slobodka,—on horse carts, old, broken down, sick people, and on foot the young ones; towards Bialystok they were led. And when they were through with the small towns, it commenced in Grodne. First came Slobodka. The first street. . . . my father,—that is, my father-in-law,—I must save my child. Possibly we should get away at night to some Poles, old acquaintances, and hide there. My husband, myself, my sister-in-law, and a girl friend who was with us, we shall get away to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_partisans">partisans</a>, and Father with the child should remain with the Poles. But he refused. And so it was. He resigned himself to death. To me he said: "Take the child and save yourselves. Go to the other <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a>. There they are still allowed to remain." I was the first to go over to the second <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> with the child. In a few days came my man. Father told him: "For the sake of the child, go!" He himself remained there. His younger daughter Zina- he could not abandon her, and they both went off with a transport, most probably to <a class="placename" href="#vothC112" type="camp">Treblinka</a>. Within a week they started the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> in the yard of the synagogue. The most horrible was that the Jewish Police (at the beginning we were not told about the horrible role they would have to play) they came and led us, assembled for the slaughter there, to the synagogue, at night. Every few nights we would sit up—I, my man (the child was asleep, all dressed, and we expected the police to come after us. Every night we said Vida (the prayer of those who expect to die) of our own composition, and forgave each other, but they did not come. My man worked then as a carpenter (he is a lumber sorter by trade), and this kept us there. Once my man said: "I can't make peace with them. Our child must be saved even if we two shall die. We have nobody any more. You look like a Christian; get out with the child. Put it next to a Christian orphanage. Orphans also may be lucky sometimes. I can't want her to die." It snowed that night. It was 25 degrees cold. [Below zero centigrade.] Sixteen Jews fell at the gate in the first attempt to escape. I went over the wires in the second attempt, and my man handed me the child, and I carried her away.</span>

I removed the yellow patch, and I went down the street. It was eight o'clock. At nine o'clock it was curfew hour. I did not know where to go. All at once I remembered a Christian woman whom I happened to know, and I went to her and said: "This is all that I have got; take the child and carry it to an orphanage. Say, you have found it in the street. I am returning to my man, and we shall perish together." She started to wring her hands, a Christian woman whom I had possibly seen only twice before. And she said: "I am afraid (the Poles were threatened with death for such things); put her in the street. I will come out of the house with a neighbor woman; we shall come out as if by accident. I will pick up the child and take her tomorrow to the orphanage, but you go away immediately." And so she has taken my child. I went with her down to the door, and there I stood across the street, hidden in the gate, and I saw how my child was lying on the snow. And here, I could not pick her up, the child that I had brought into the world! I knew that that will save her life. That is what I hoped. [A few words in this sentence are not clear. She is sobbing, and even by slowing down the wire and listening to this section over and over, I have been able to understand only about three words. I do not think that the translation of the phrase "the child I brought into the world" is entirely correct.] In a few minutes she came out of the house and picked up the child. I ran away through the streets of <a class="placename" href="#vothL189">Grodno</a>, and I didn't think of the curfew—that I might be caught,—and I didn't know how to get back to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a>, as it was such a late hour. There was a Christian woman in the city, with whom I had once worked during the time of the Soviets. I stepped in to her, and a girl friend of mine was hiding there. I entered the house, and I said, "Panuvka *This is a respectful and at the same time endearing name for a Polish woman. *, I don't have my child any more. How light my hands feel!" Then she said, "Twenty-six hours you have suffered to bring her into the world, and now you will suffer as long as you live." I didn't ask her for much—just to keep me over night. She couldn't help me for much longer, because on Sunday no one could show himself in the city. The Germans were grabbing the people and dragging them to work in Germany. I wanted to return to the <a class="placename" href="#vothC38" type="camp">ghetto</a>. Then thousand Jews were deported that day. The <a class="placename" href="#vothC38" type="camp">ghetto</a> was surrounded. One couldn't get in, nor could one get out. Part were going to <a class="placename" href="#vothC112" type="camp">Treblinka</a>, and to get in one also didn't know how. I ran into a Christian—he was a working man. [Recording not clear.] I told him I am a Jewess—"I can't get into the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a>." And he said, "Get out of the city. You do not look Jewish. Go where ever you can, but don't remain here. You see here it burns." And so I departed alone, without papers, into the woods. I did not know the roads. Through the woods, into a Russian village. I entered. "Give me some water." If one is alive, one has to drink water. And sometimes one has to eat. Everybody gave me something. I did not look Jewish, but they knew—what else could be driving me in the snow through the woods? Everyone kept me for one night.</span>

But it drove me back to <a class="placename" href="#vothC38" type="camp">Grodno</a> to find out what was going on. The priest encountered some Jews that were going to work. She he asked them: "Do you know whether Jack Kovitzki is there?" So they said: "He is there, he has remained alive." Three thousand Jews were still in <a class="placename" href="#vothC38" type="camp">Grodno</a>. So he said, "Tell him that his wife is alive—that she does not want to remain among us. She wants to go back, and in a few days she will be back." The next week he took me out part of the way in a cart—to go further, he was afraid. And I went alone towards <a class="placename" href="#vothL189">Grodno</a>—I can't remember how many kilometers. I arrived in <a class="placename" href="#vothL189">Grodno</a>.

He lives now in the yard of the house that once belonged to my father-in-law. So I went to him. He didn't know me, but I gave the name of Meyer Kovitzki, and he said: "Don't be afraid. You can be with me as long as you want." But he had a wife and a child, and I did not want to cause him anxiety. So I went down to the cellar, and he went to the <a class="placename" href="#vothC38" type="camp">ghetto</a> to find out about things, and Friday morning his own wife went with me through the streets, and she led me to the <a class="placename" href="#vothC38" type="camp">ghetto</a>. Then another Pole helped me to get in. But before I went in, he told me: "You know where you are going?" And I said, "Where is my man, and where is my place?" That was on Friday noon. I was there all night until five o'clock in the morning. At five o'clock in the morning again shooting and screaming. A new transport. And I and my husband went to this transport towards the synagogue. Then the whole night we stayed in the synagogue. In the synagogue it was crowded—heavy and crowded. One could not breathe. The whole night without a drop of water, and outside the shooting. At two o'clock in the morning we were driven out to the train. And my husband said: "No, you are not going to die. Because you have returned to me, is that why you should perish?" And I said, "I cannot be—I am already tired. Maybe I shall rest in the grave." But he did not wish to understand, and just one street away from the train he pushed me into a gate, in spite of the guards, because it was still dark. We remained standing in the gateway until morning. We both took off our [yellow] patches. What to do now?</span>

And the Christian woman heard it, and she said to me [and here she imitates a voice of extreme surprise], "You know about Dante? How do you come to know anything about Dante?"

Christians normally did not go to the ovens, only those who had died. But for the Jews she had to fight. Two years ago [this with some hidden light in her voice] on Rosh Hashona [the interview was taking place on Rosh Hashona of 1946, and she apparently refers to an incident exactly two years before] just two years ago, there was to be a selection. A selection was when they re-sorted the people—who for the ovens and who should stay alive. So she took all the weak and the sick, including myself, and sent them away outside the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> for work, Aussenkomando, so they should not be present for the "selection."

And because I looked so [decrepit] they thought that I was such a fool! In a few days I learned the mechanism of my machine, and in a few days I started to work very ardently. The assigned quota was twelve thousand, but I would produce fifteen thousand pieces. But fifteen thousand smaller ones and fifteen thousand larger ones, never the caliber that was prescribed. When they discovered it, there were eighty thousand rejected pieces. My foreman came over to me and said: "If you do it once more, I shall chop off your hand." So I said, "Oh [here her voice becomes ironical, and she speaks in perfect German], you can report that I am doing sabotage? Then they make me altogether kaput." "Oh, for that you are much too dumb!" I don't know, maybe he had noticed what I was doing, but it may have been too late, and he already was responsible along with me. I can't be so naive as to assume that the Germans wanted to cooperate with me against Hitler. Such do not exist. But to the last moment they had fate. In the faces of the Germans I read just like in a newspaper. They were very sad the last days. It was already the year 1945, in March. They still drove us to work, and they would beat us at every air raid alarm. But, thank God! The air raid alarm would last for twenty-four hours. They would run into the air raid shelter, and we would run right out into the yard. We would run out into the yard, and laugh, and the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> men would say to us: "Aren't you afraid? Do you think that your friends will spare you?" [She continues with laughter in her voice] "You are afraid! Why aren't you in the battlefield? All you are fighting with is eight hundred defenseless and weak women. That is the kind of heroes you are!" The girls thought that I was again insane, like I had been in <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. But it was indifferent to me. [Here again the record loses its clearness]. To die in such a fashion may be well worth while. The 27th of March we were driven out of <a class="placename" href="#vothC64" type="camp">Lippstadt</a>.</span>

And I still thought that I would have a chance to eat that half a bread in case he should not return. But it has become very late. And it happened the first of April, 1945, a quarter of nine.

Somebody had a bandage around a wounded leg, and that bandage was raised at an approaching American tank, and the women prostrated themselves on the ground, kissing the wheels. The Americans thought it was a house of the insane. They looked at us. [I am not sure of the correct translation of the next few sentences.] And how we looked! All in tatters. [Her words are barely audible.] And speaking—nobody could. We were all speechless. And then he understood, and two tears rolled down his face. [Again the text is not clear, she is very upset.] And until the others arrived, he wept with us. Not a Jew—a Christian. And then they began to arrive, the tanks. It was Passover. The last day of it. And matzos [Unleavened bread, eaten by Jews at Easter] fell from the tanks. And chocolate and cigarettes. And they would jump off the tanks and they were kissing us. Us dirty and lousy ones. "Do not weep," they would say. But we wept more and again. And incessantly the tears ran. The Ninth Army had not seen any Jews in Germany, and we thought that we were the only Jewish survivors, and we did not want to live. But they consoled us. They were telling us that there were many other armies that have reached other <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lagers</a> which were liberated. That was liberation. We were all dead sick. I was half swollen. Immediately the American army led us into homes. They burned everything we had on us, although we wanted to save the clothing. But it was all infected, and we were afraid to keep it. Dirty. And we changed our clothes, putting on whatever we could. We could take things, good things, from the Germans. We took it from the Germans [with irony in her voice], they gave it to us themselves. They were afraid now. We dressed [here her voice again breaks into sobs]. We washed ourselves, with soap, warm water, a clean towel, pure underwear. [She uses the English word "pure"]. Oh! The Americans themselves were crazy with joy. They now understood—"You are going to liberate human beings." And that army hadn't seen before those who were liberated. We were the first ones, and they were rejoicing like little children. And in the evening one American put on his head a hat, a German hat, a womans hat, and another one played some kind of instrument, and he danced with a little girl from our <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. I shall not forget it, ever.

It is not on the wire, but here it is, written from memory: "Last night, and that means on the first evening of Rosh Hashona we, like at home, prepared the holiday meal, and as was customary at home, we invited a soldier to share it with us. But this time it was not a poor soldier, away from home, who had to be fed, but an American Jewish soldier, who, accepting the invitation, brought us an armful of gifts, all kinds of American food and delicacies."]</span>

                    The German term meaning “Muslim.” The term applied to prisoners in camps close to dying from starvation and exhaustion. Their skeletal faces were devoid of expression, and they seemed to have been overcome by despair and by the absence of the will to live. The origin of the term has not been definitively established, though it has been attributed to a certain similarity to a prostrate Muslim in prayer.

                    Acronym for the German Schutzstaffel (“Protective Echelon”), a major Nazi organization. It grew from a small paramilitary unit to a powerful force that served as Hitler's "Praetorian Guard," the Nazi Party's "Shield Squadron" and a force that, fielding almost a million men (both on the front lines and as political police), managed to exert as much political influence as the German Army. Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
