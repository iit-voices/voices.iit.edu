Only a small part [of the Jews], the healthier ones, were led away to Germany to the concentration camps, and there they were compelled to work hard physically . . . the hardest physical labor; and the largest part has perished. And as a consequence, a certain 'complex' has developed among the 'liberated Jews,' a negative attitude towards work. And for us, the public workers, the responsible people who stand at the head of the Jewish commonwealth in Germany, it is the task to endeavor to extirpate this negative complex, to eradicate it from the soul of the Jewish person, and to enlighten him and tell [him], 'Times are different and conditions are different; and therefore, the attitude towards work must be entirely different.' And that is the most important job which I am doing at the present. We endeavor, by various methods, to rehabilitate the Jewish person towards work. And by means of this we intend to liberate him from the dark past [?] and prepare him for a brighter and clearer future—with faith in people, faith in life, and faith in himself, since this is the most important thing in achieving a healthy personality.</span>

He continues in a solemn voice as if 'Once an orator, always an orator,' or as if 'No opportunity should be missed to work for the cause, which in his case, has definitely absorbed his existence.'] First of all [?], the heavy, bitter disappointment in the future. The Jews in Germany have believed and thought that first of all . . . first of all, attention would be directed towards those people who have gone through so much, and have lived through so much. And therefore, we thought that only a short time would pass and the possibility would be created that we would be able to depart for such a country, in a Jewish community, where we could lead a real life and could forget the 'climate', land, and people who brought over us so much suffering and misfortune. A Jew in Germany who moves about surrounded completely by Germans—among Germans—is unable to forget the grave experiences. Besides the Jews in Germany are compelled to look on and see that they who once lived a fine and citizenlike life, possessing everything; and then the Germans had everything taken away and have ruined everything that they possessed—materially and spiritually . . . and these people [the Germans] live a normal life in beautiful apartments, apartments consisting of several rooms; they are able to have everything. And moreover, many, many of their criminals go around at liberty in disguise, and are being abetted by the German population. And still more, one does not see any spiritual transformation or change in the German people. We do not hear and we do not see that what we have expected, and that what we have observed in other people—and especially among us Jews. When the Jewish people have ever committed any misdeeds against God or man, or nations, any social deed, any immoral deed, we had our people who stood up, . . . our prophets who shouted to the people and appealed to the conscience of the people, and would tell them that they had committed a crime and that the crime had to be atoned for.But one does not notice the like . . . one does not observe the like in the German people. And that, too, is one of the greatest disappointments, and that is one of the greatest outrages which plagues the Jewish person. And he asks . . . Who knows . . . ? Who knows whether or not in a very short time, this malicious, poisonous swine in the heart of Europe, will rise again and will gorge himself, gorge himself again—to give humanity an encore of what he has planned before—to bring death to all progress of mankind?</span>

Third, another flow of people came who, too, were in hiding under '<a class="term" href="#vothG_aryan">Aryan</a> papers;' were hidden in families, in better Christian families—they came to us with their whole families. Also, very many marriages were consumated within that year; and today, there are daily many, many weddings. And so, as if nature is intending to make good for this great loss which occurred due to this greatest of Jewish catastrophes, we see very many births at present. Daily tenths of births. The Jewish person who had to live all that time in concentration camps, be it as a man, be it as a woman, separated; and suffering at present the mighty disappointment in not finding his family in [word not clear]; and everyone is endeavoring to achieve an intimate family life. And through this fact, many families are being founded, close families.

The Jews once had a custom that when one lived to [see] a new holiday the oration was: Shehekheyonu, Vkijmonu, vhigiyonu hazman haze. [Translation: Who hast kept us alive, hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach these times. He omits, as is often done for purposes of quotation or reference, the first half of the 'brokha', the blessing which in complete form reads: Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has kept us etc.] And now upon the great miracle that has come over this trifle of Jews, a prayer should also be said. But where does one see the 'zman haze' [these times], because the zman haze is not the zman haze. It is not [the instant] that we hoped for and not [the instant] what we have come to. I have not come to you to render a report about Lithuania, my Lithuania, where I led the seventeen years of <a class="term" href="#vothG_ort">ORT</a> work, in Lithuania. Fourteen years of normal and three years [of work] in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">Ghetto</a>. In the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">Ghetto</a>, in a small little house on Slobodka [common name for the poor section of town, the other side of the tracks, simi-slums] just across the large, proud and mighty building of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ort">ORT</a>, which was called 'Arise to Work,' which I had built together with all my friends. And how we looked through the tiny windowpanes of this large, proud and mighty building. Not about this Lithuania shall I speak, and not about the Lithuanian Jews shall I now speak. I have been, I had the honor [gratification—the word is in Hebrew] to build the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ort">ORT</a>, and to be present at the funeral of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ort">ORT</a> in Lithuania. I shall now speak about [the] Jews in the American Zone, about the Jews of the 'Sheris' . . . of the significant name 'Sheris Hapleitah' [remnants of the refugees] as it is being called; the largest present-day Jewish <a class="term" href="#vothG_kibbutz">Kibbutz</a>] collective working community] in Germany, which counts according to our data, according to the data, of the data of the official Jewish representation chosen by democratic elections, from ninety to one hundred thousand. I shall speak today [about] the majority, about these Jews, about the Sheris Hapleitah, about those little remnants of Jews from Poland, Lithuania, Rumania and all . . . Hungary and all cit [ies] . . . countries, communities, which have perished, and the people, and Jews, who have reassembled in Germany. Before I shall turn to speak of the work of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ort">ORT</a>, which we accomplished in the immediate [?] months after the liberation, I consider it my duty and I consider it necessary to give you a bird's view, a short, condensed sketch, on the way in which the present Jewish commonwealth in the American Zone was created . . . What kind of human material represents by itself this Jewish
                        commonwealth [ishuv]? And I should like very much to give you an insight into the difficult, abnormal conditions [under which] the struggle for life has to be waged by this, our heavily tried, suffering people of ours; and what material, what spiritual, inner and exterior factors were operative during these sixteen months after liberation—contributing to arouse deep transformations [?], deep changes in the spiritual, or better expressed, in the psychological condition—psychological thinking, of the remainder of Eastern European Jewery. With this [survey] you will understand better the whole new problematic situation which has been created by the Sheris Hapleitah and you will be able to apprehend all those problems which I wish to present to you in connection with the great, important work of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ort">ORT</a> as it affects the Jews in Germany.</span>

Although I am one of them in flesh and blood, I want to do it 'facing it squarely' because I know that there is being talked a lot over the Sheris Hapleitah and much is being said about the Sheris Hapleitah, but it is being greatly exaggerated, be it in the positive sense, be it in the negative sense. Things are being overrated and understated, and many of you have no clear presentation about the way this commonwealth lives—this wandering commonwealth—which is in a constant state of wandering around; which finds itself—the homeless part of which finds itself—in motion; and through that [my explanation] a great deal will be cleared up.</span>

There have remained fifteen, twenty thousands Jews alive through such a great miracle. Does one [the world] have to think of the future?

But to the greater part of experienced community workers it was clear, that we shall have to remain [in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_dp">DP</a> camps] for long, and we see it already. We knew before the war what happened to prisoners of war, and so we knew it would definitely take a longer time and we would have to stay in Germany. And that is why we devoted ourselves to more serious problems, about how and what to do; and to organize temporarily the Jewish life in Germany. And for that reason, the political task of creating purely Jewish <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lagers</a> was one of the utmost importance. First, because in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lagers</a> have remained the criminals, and the murderers of us [those who committed at one time, crimes and murder against us] and of our families. There are at present in Germany not only [two words in Hebrew provisionally, translated as [local domestic criminals [?] [Germany is [not only a sediment basin of German criminals, millions of Nazis for whom the whole race bears the guilt for that what has come over us and the democracies of the whole world, but Germany is a sediment basin of Ukranians, Whites [here it means Czarist Russians], Poles [he uses Polacks, which in Eastern Europe does not always have the connotation of contemp], and Lithuanians and Letts—those criminals which are afraid to return home for the day of Judgment [reckoning] which is expecting them.

During the last month alone, fifteen to twenty thousand Jews have arrived. And if once we have thought that we may have to remain for a month, or two, or three, and if the Jews have born some illusionary hopes, I do not agree . . . I observe a phenomenon in our life, I who am about them, in them [in their midst], and between them, of a different nature [??]. The Jews brood, and go on brooding. Such life forces them to think very seriously about their future; and although they know that life in Germany will last much longer than was counted for, and if it should even happen that they should soon be admitted to the Land of Israel, the hundred thousand, it still would take a long time until this whole process would be completed.</span>

And we threw ourselves at still more work, and we went to another <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, a second one, a third one; and nowadays we have two and a half thousand Jews learning a trade in the American Zone. Listen to this [??], we have seventy courses today . . . seventy-five. But we have a variety of courses. Twenty-five courses that I could enumerate for you but I don't want to take so much time because I still want to talk briefly over the tasks before the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ort">ORT</a>—Twenty-five courses, various courses, machine shop, wood shop, automobile works, machine shop and extra welding shops, plumbing, radio, typewriter, carpentry, weaving, ceramics, womens' wear, millinery, [word not clear], underwear, [word not clear]—whatever you want [word not clear], bookkeeping; all courses are filled and when I arrive at a <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> I find a desk full of requests—'come to the Land of Israel [?] and install trade schools.'</span>

Switzerland has given us not only machinery and tools, but my stay in Switzerland has given me . . . it refreshed me. Since my stay in Switzerland I came to see a new world and new people. I started remembering [thinking about] a new life. And so I began to conceive new forms of rehabilitation and new opportunities. I have seen the new, the new, and I beheld a people, a land which has not gone through the holocaust—and from which one may learn . . . and I am introducing it now into all the schools, and I assemble my teachers and I enlighten them, and so the work proceeds.</span>

Possibly it will emerge later during the debate—but now I want to tell you thus: before the American Zone stands a very great, important fact. <a class="term" href="#vothG_unrra">UNRRA</a>, the military, whoever you want, who knows who finds it proper [??]; they want that the Jews should be kept busy. The Jews should be occupied working. We too, want it. But we say thus: we want it on different grounds. We want that Jews should be occupied with work only for the sake of two aspects. One aspect is that demoralization should not go on further, and that the uncertainty [this is definitely a guess. The word is not clear and appears much more forceful] which gnaws [?] at us from day to day, and the despair.</span>

We have from forty-one to forty-five thousand Jews which could be occupied out of the ninety thousand. We estimate that from the ages of sixteen to forty-five . . . we estimate that . . . that these are seventy-five percent of us. A young element—an element for work. We are able to occupy about from two thousand to two thousand five hundred [corrects himself], from twenty thousand to twenty-five thousand in industries. We want to work. We have Jew arte . . . artesans; we have Jews in various skills. We say, 'gladly'; order and we shall do it. For the American Military—gladly! We shall do it—it shall be done. Give us factories. There are factories in Germany in which we could work for them. We could take them over under our administration, start them going and occupy Jews; and not be working for the depreciated, insignificant package which we are given there, and for the inferior canned stuff and other things [he refers to small packages which were designated for prisoners of war and remained in the storehouses of the Red Cross]. We should get paid for the work in such factories in American currency. If you don't want to pay him here, fine! You will pay him abroad, wherever he should emigrate. He should have it in the future to build his life, and he should be able to settle in some way.</span>

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
