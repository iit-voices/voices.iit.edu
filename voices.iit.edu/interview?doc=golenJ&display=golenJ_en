I am tempted to go over there and take part in the services later but I'm taking time out since I have here with me Mr. Judah Golen, a representative of the Jewish agency of Palestine,—for Palestine—and since I have met a number of these men and women . . . often in Italy and France on railroad trains and so on . . . I have decided to take out this morning out and he has graciously agreed to tell us something about the work of the representatives of the Jewish Agency for Palestine which, according to him, has about a hundred people working in the various <a class="term" href="#vothG_dp">DP</a> camps. Also, Mr. Golen, would you be so kind first of all to tell who you are and then let's go on with the story. The microphone is yours for as much time as you want.</span>

What we, the Jewish Agency, is doing now is "A:" . . . the language which is Jewish and the Hebrew language is common with the Jews who come from Poland. Many, many of those Jews do not know English or any other language in which they could converse with the people who come from America. The Jewish Agency is establishing schools with the aid of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ajdc">AJDC</a>—the teachers come from Palestine.

Also the question of the language which is more common between the Palestinian Jew and the Jew from Poland whether it's Yiddish or Hebrew because I see I am really surprised to see a great number of Jews coming from Lithuania, Poland and other countries in Eastern Europe speak fluently Hebrew—speak fluent Hebrew—which is again a sign of attachment to the Jewish people and to Palestine.

Let me ask you this question: "In your impression—you mentioned the poor—do all <a class="term" href="#vothG_dp">DPs</a>, all displaced Jews, or all of we couldn't say, but what do you estimate? What percentage of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_dp">DPs</a> and which age groups long for Palestine and which one would want to go to America, South America, Australia, South Africa and other places?" You couldn't say that everyone wants to go to Palestine?</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="#golenJ" start="867.118" end="x">Well I'll you exactly how it is—I'll tell you. Immediately after the war and during the war, as far as I know in my conversations with various Jews in various camps, Palestine was the only light which really gave them some energy to . . . stand and to wait until victory comes. I admit that there has been some disappointment among many Jews because external difficulties—we cannot ignore the various political difficulties existing in Palestine and outside. The Jews are not the only masters of Palestine and they could not bring over so many Jews as they wanted. But . . . and these difficulties naturally caused the various Jews in Europe to feel bitter at the time against those elements who did not allow them to come to the place where they longed and they thought they belonged. There may be quite a number of Jews who now, after seeing these difficulties, try to find another place to [?] and to have some peace—peace of mind and peace of body. People move for South Africa where they have relatives there, people move for America—especially the United States—I . . . and people certainly move for Palestine. These are I would say apart from—and you may have some Jews who would like to go to Australia. I consider that all those Jews who do want to go to places outside of Palestine are Jews who have some relatives in there and some hope that they would be able to enter a new life in those countries. As far as I see prospects are not very large. Neither America, although America has shown a great—what should I say—great generosity . . . I can't . . . whether this is the word . . . towards accepting Jews into their land. This would not solve the problem because the problem is a matter of, at least now, two hundred thousand Jews who are now in Austria and German zones—not to mention the Jews who are expected here from Poland.</span>

As I said, unfortunately, the number of certificates is so small that it's become rather . . . the certificate is less important than anything because of its . . . the difficulty of getting it . . . because of its non-existence, I would say. The Palestinian offices have now almost no work to do. But the Jewish Agency is establishing these Palestinian offices with the hope that certificates would be granted—in a greater number—and then the work would start again. "What are the Palestinian offices doing exactly and how do they give the certificates?" There are various categories: "A:" there are relatives in Palestine like fathers who have their sons in Europe or husbands who have left their wives in Europe—these have the priority. Again, you have sons who have their parents, sisters who have their brothers—these have, again, the priority. After that comes the efficiency of the man.

And the group goes over to Palestine as a group. There, they are immediately absorbed in one of the settlements so that the economic question is not existing at all. Again you have, before the war we had also a category of "capitalists." That we, as Jews who owned over a thousand pounds, were allowed to be given—were allowed to come to Palestine under such certificate. These were also distributed in conjunction with the Jewish Agency. But government itself—British government—could also give certificates for people without even consulting the Jewish Agency (as to this question of these capitalists). We have also "professional certificates." Doctors and other professional . . . professions who would receive certificates in the same way as capitalists received certificates. The . . .</span>

So that they, at the time when the certificates are available, they take into consideration the immediate necessity of the number of certificates needed to a certain place. If, for example, during the war, there was hope to help and to save Jews from Rumania they then sent a greater number of certificates to Rumania at that time.

That means if a man knows the work of watch-repairing or watch-making in the kibbutz, he will not be paid, it will be his profession and he gets for the work he does his food and his clothing and his health service and he's being taken care of by the various people around—he should have been taken care of—for that he gives his work, whatever he can do whether its watch-making or whether its another way. He will not pay his friend. "A:" his friend will not ask for money, "B:" the <a class="term" href="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</a> is responsible to the watch to run smoothly and they will pay for the repairing expenses.</span>

If the British have some interest in Palestine they would—in order to carry out such interest, in order to come to the object of what they have they would recruit people who they think would serve their own purpose better. You ask "why don't they recruit Jews—the Jewish people in Palestine—for that purpose?" The question is what is the purpose? At wartime when there was the war they tried to recruit as many Jews as they were able to—to put them to the front. And many, many Jews—over thirty-five thousand Jews joined the British Army and fought in all fields—in Europe, in North Africa, Syria and other places. Now, if the British authorities try to recruit men—it means to, they think, to keep order in the Middle East and they would certainly like to have British people more than Jewish people from Palestine.</span>

The Jews in Palestine, as I've said before—after having experienced so many atrocities all over the world, all over history, have decided to be in some respect the masters of their own life and in this respect they have organized without even any . . . instigation on the part of any leadership but within themselves they have organized themselves into a defense force. This defense force is comprised of practically every Jew who is able to give a hand in the defense machinery. Their object is certainly not aggressive—it has never been aggressive—they have proved their . . . the right of their existence in the various riots which took place since they have tried to come back to Palestine. They never meant to take anything away from others by force—whether it's land, whether it's property, whether it's any other right or ownership. What the thing is . . . the idea is to keep whatever they have got for themselves and not to allow others to take it away which we have seen in so many—so many times to have been carried out. The haganah has been appearing in the various [press?] and has been heard all over the world as a result of the last act being carried out in Palestine. One should distinguish the haganah from any other terrorist or from any terrorist organization. The haganah it would not be justified it would be entirely incorrect to call the haganah a 'terrorist organization.' It's true, there are some . . . there are two organizations who would be . . . would consider themselves . . . terrorists in the sense of attacking British property or rather Palestinian government property. These are young men who experienced hardships out of Palestine, who psychologically were badly influenced as a result of what had gone over . . . what has passed from themselves and from their parents. Young men who lost their families and who hoped to be able to establish themselves in Palestine after experience . . . experiencing so many disappointments as a result of political difficulties they have gone over to accuse the British in that and from the point of accusing they have also tried to carry out certain terrorist acts as I said, destroying property of the British. They are not in the sense of—there are differences even between themselves—but they are not under any Jewish organization or Jewish authority. And the Jewish institutions openly and sincerely oppose to such and undisciplined, and I would say unwise, acts being carried out by these young men.</span>

I would say the Arab nation as a whole is not so much afraid of the Jews who want to come to Palestine as it's being tried to be . . . as people try to show it. It's true that there are a number of Arab leaders who consider it their duty to arise within the Arab population such fears but from experience till now we know that the more the Jews—the more Jews arrive in Palestine the better off were the Arabs in Palestine, economically—and not only economically—socially, politically, and many other respects. One thing should be clear, clearly told. Palestine is not and cannot be a country for one nation only. Palestine was the cradle of three religions, Palestine is the land of many nations, and Palestine originated . . . [?] origin the Jewish people and various other nations. It cannot be the land of one nation. This has also been establish by the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. In this sense what the Arabs say that "no Jew has any right to this country called Palestine" is, I would say, a mistake and a historical mistake. The Jews say that they cannot—they will never displace any Arabs from their country but to that I would like to add that every Jew has a right to this country as long as no Arab is being displaced and the intention of the Jews is to come to Palestine and develop the country in such a way that would let both people live peacefully . . . each at the side of the other.</span>

History shows us that Palestine used to be a most . . . one of the most fruitful countries in the Middle East. It had millions of population about two thousand years ago. And with energy, finance, work, and strong rule Palestine can return to its original situation. The Jews who have come to Palestine during the last fifty years have mainly developed neglected land. Such land as can be found. The Jews own now only six percent of the land of the country. So you have another 96 . . . 94%. Out of that you have some land belonging to the Arabs, developed by them, more extensively than the Jewish development but in addition to that you have large tracts of land entirely neglected. You have almost half the size of Palestine which is called the Negev—the southern part which is now a desert. The Jews claim it and they hope to be able to reclaim it. That means to develop the land, to plant there, they have already a few stations there—kind of an experimenting station . . . where they try to find water by all means—scientific means—in their hands. And they have proved already a success. In the middle of the desert down south of Palestine near the Sinai, near the [?] you have Jewish settlements where no person thought of any possibility to plant trees there and to sew crops there. Now they are gathering the fruit very happily. We have remnants of old towns in the times of the Crusades there, which shows that this desert was once inhabited. What we want is to inhabit those neglected settlements again without affecting in any way the people who are already in Palestine.</span>

When I say without any body interrupting them it doesn't mean in other settlements religion is being interrupted. On the contrary—in every settlement, practically every settlement, you have a shul—a synagogue—where all the parents go to pray and where the younger people whoever want, can go and pray.

And in the religious settlements, certainly, there is no question of smoking on Saturday because they keep Sabbath fully and to the last point. But even in town Jews . . .

On the one part the religious Jews understand that they cannot make every Jew religious by force, they are trying to preach—to induce opportunity to be more religious, but they don't use force. There is a small force of younger, fanatic religious Jews who try to interrupt the traffic on the eve of Shabbat but they are really a very negligible part of the whole and really can't be taken into consideration.
