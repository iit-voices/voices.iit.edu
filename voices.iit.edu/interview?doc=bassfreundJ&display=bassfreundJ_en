In 1941 I was forcibly taken from school and was compelled to work in a factory. That was already the military labor service into which the Jews also were taken. I was assigned to a factory where I was working at shells and my mother was also working there, punching shells. In those times one could not escape work. It was compulsory and if one would try to avoid it, it was considered sabotage and one was consequently arrested, or, as it happened to many, one just disappeared.</span>

But I extricated myself by a trick. The transport had to leave after the daily <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>—which usually occurred in the evening—that is after work when a count was taken daily to see whether some people had disappeared, have gone astray or have run away. And when these reports—as they were called in the concentration camp—were transmitted to the "Obersturmführer", the commander of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, I simply marched off to work instead of the gas killing for which I was assigned.</span>

You see <a class="placename" href="#vothL135">Cracow</a> was within sixty kilometers from us and rumors trickled through that the Russians were already in <a class="placename" href="#vothL135">Cracow</a>.

We still had to work during the day, and we returned in the evening to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. We were the last ones to go to transport. It was very cold that day.

You see, we left after the women, and we overtook them, and we saw en route many dead bodies of women lying on the ground. We marched at night and we had to rest during the day, so that the people should not see us being led through, and evenings when it was dark we marched on again.</span>

One couldn't sleep nights. We were simply all sitting up and leaning against each other, and when one just barely moved or made an attempt to walk around, there appeared immediately a <a class="term" href="#vothG_bver">BVer</a> with a big club and began to strike indiscriminately into the crowd. It was terrible. And then the second day we were told that a transport is getting ready. I quickly volunteered for it because I thought that it can't be worse than in this <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. We were getting very little food, a very thin watery soup, and even the customary turnips were often missing, and a piece of bread. Then we were sent away. It leaked out that this transport was going to <a class="placename" href="#vothC25" type="camp">Dachau</a>. We stepped forward, we were given a plate of soup, and accompanied by <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> we were sent to the station and were loaded into wagons.

When eighty people sat down the others had no place where to stand, and there were many people who were very tired. It was not possible otherwise; one stood "over" another. We trampled on other people's fingers, and these people, of course, resisted and were striking at others, and so a panic ensued. It was so terrible that people went crazy during the trip and soon we had the first death among us. And we didn't know where to put the dead—on the floor they were taking up space—because they had to lie stretched out. And there it occurred to us—we had a blanket with us, so we wrapped the dead man into the blanket, and there were two iron bars in the car and so we tied him on above us.</span>

But soon we understood that that won't do because we had more and more dead due to the heat in the car, and the bodies began to smell. And that is how we were travelling. There were the German troop transports retreating from the front because the front was receding, and they had to retreat further. All the tracks were blocked and we had to stand for days to let the troop transports through first, and at night one could not see a thing. And one was beaten and trampled. In my case it was so that my trousers, my prisoner's trousers, were torn longwise and I couldn't wear my trousers any more. And I remained in my underpants. And so without any nourishment, without a drop of water, and there was snow outside, the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> gave us nothing. And we—there was a mass of insane and dead people in the car and after continuous travelling for five days we arrived in <a class="placename" href="#vothL387">Regensburg</a>. And it was already night and the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> opened the doors and said if we throw out the dead bodies we shall get some food. And so I myself, together with a friend, removed twenty-five dead bodies from this car and laid them outside in the snow, you see? And then we were given a piece of bread and a little beaker of soup. The Red Cross had there their feeding point so we had to line up before the cars and each was given some, car after car.</span>

But one was so exhausted from the long trip, if one hasn't eaten anything for five days and nights. I have been standing all the way during this trip and I saved my life only because I had fastened to the car a piece of rope and held on tight. It was indeed utterly impossible. For instance, a friend of mine who withstood all these years in <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>, went insane during the trip and attempted to attack us with a knife and four of us, even five, had to hold him, otherwise he would have killed somebody. It was decidedly a panic. We always were afraid of the night because at night we couldn't see when one approached the other. The whole car was in a tumult, and we heard later when we arrived in <a class="placename" href="#vothC25" type="camp">Dachau</a> that in the open cars it was the same. At least there they had air, but part of the people froze [to death]. And when we arrived in <a class="placename" href="#vothC25" type="camp">Dachau</a> there were more dead bodies than survivors. It were the younger people who withstood it. In <a class="placename" href="#vothC25" type="camp">Dachau</a> itself I was altogether three weeks. I still want to tell you that in <a class="placename" href="#vothC25" type="camp">Dachau</a> raged at my time the great epidemic of spotted typhus, and entire barracks were dying out. In the morning the dead were put on hay-carts, one with the head on this side, the other with the feet on this side—loaded on the hay wagons and driven for cremation. I don't know today, myself, how the epidemic of spotted typhus had spared us, because around our barracks, in front and on the sides there were barracks with spotted typhus—it was terrible. Most of the people have tried to wash themselves as often as possible during the day to escape this epidemic because there were swarms of lice at that time in <a class="placename" href="#vothC25" type="camp">Dachau</a>. And three weeks later, after we marched past the <a class="term" href="#vothG_commandant">commandant</a> of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> of <a class="placename" href="#vothC25" type="camp">Dachau</a>, he made the selection, who goes to transport and who remains in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> of invalids.

The Nazis intended to drag away "on transport" all those who were able to walk at all so that they should not fall into American hands. I recently met here at the Funkenkaserne a friend who was there with me. He told me that they went through an awful lot. They were embarked into trains and the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> told them they may run away because the Americans were already near, and while they were running they started to shoot them in the back and they were again rounded up, again embarked in railroad cars and driven away for some distance. Then the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> fled and the Americans didn't know who were on the train and there was still a dive bomber attack that cost the lives of a large number of prisoners and from all I heard it was a catastrophic event. At first it was ordered that the sick be shot, but then the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> commander got scared, because at this "late" hour he was afraid to comply with the order, and we simply remained lying there.</span>

I had contacts with Christians and I must tell you that these people have almost no understanding for our situation. When you tell some people that you are coming from a concentration camp they say, "Well my relatives were killed by bombs and that is just as bad." And then there are others who say that they didn't know what was going on in the concentration camps and if they would have known they couldn't say anything anyway, because they would have been afraid that they themselves could be taken to concentration camps. There are quite divergent viewpoints. I must tell you, however, that one hears but very rarely an admission on part of the Germans that these things were wrong.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="#bassfreundJ" start="3876.614" end="x">That is hard to tell. The Germans believe that the Americans will build them up again. For instance I have heard quite often the opinion: "Well, you are a Jew; you are going now to America; see to it that the Jews from America should come here and revive our trade." And these are their naive and childish views. At least a large part of them think so. And they cannot understand that Germany now doesn't mean anything to us in spite of the fact that we are born there. It is clear that in a country where one has been deprived of everything—first of his parents, a loss that is of course irreparable, if one has lost them, one cannot have any sentiment for such a country.</span>

            Boder's question reveals the general lack of awareness of the conditions within the camps that existed at the time. Sixty-four kilograms (about 140 pounds) would have been an impossible weight for anyone who had spent as much time in the camps as Bassfreund.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
