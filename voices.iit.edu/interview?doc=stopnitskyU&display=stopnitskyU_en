On the [door] leading to the gas chamber was a sign in German "bathhouse". The people simply marched in and there occurred the gas-killing. Sometimes it would last fifteen minutes, five, minutes, sometimes an hour, sometimes two hours. This depended on the experimentation with various gases which were manufactured by the I. G.

We for instance excavated stories deep in the ground, we constructed various kinds of cellars, we constructed [double] walls, so with the first threats of danger one could hide because we had . . . as soon as Russia entered the war, we had information that America and England have allied themselves with the European powers, so we thought that help is near and we will be able to hold out two, three, or even four months live through in the hideouts. But time has shown that that was a mistake and we were unable to hide. The 1st of August, 1943, we were informed that <a class="placename" href="#vothL101">Bedzin</a> is to become Jew-clean. No Jew should be found in <a class="placename" href="#vothL101">Bedzin</a>.

When we arrived at the railroad station, we had to wait for one hour, and then arrived thirty cattle cars, cars in which cattle are being transported, animals. [The cattle cars in Europe are not like the American stock cars with provisions for plenty of ventilation; they are simply solidly closed freight cars with possibly a small window near the ceiling. In most cases these were the old type freight cars on four wheels which had the inscription, "Forty men or eight horses." But normally when people such as soldiers or railroad working men were transported in such cars, they were provided with plank beds and the doors were kept open for ventilation.] There were no facilities to get in into these cars, but in the cars that were standing at the railroad platform [the train was apparently longer than the small platform of the little town] at the railroad station, in these [cars] entered a hundred sixty people into each car.</span>

After having gone through such misfortunes, it is obvious that it has no sense to remain in the goles, and of sheer resignation after these misfortunes, I arrived here in <a class="placename" href="#vothL19">HÃ©nonville</a> in order to get by any means, be it legal or illegal, notwithstanding any obstacles or deterrents. [I am not sure of the last two words], just to reach the land of Israel. Because to end one's days as a human being, and to live how one should, is possible only in the land of Israel. Even to die we have seen already that the goles [exile from the Holy Land] may give us some twenty good years again [I am not sure of the translation], but afterwards . . . it does not give us any point of assurance against further extermination, massacres. It has no sense to remain further in exile because it may lead to [a situation] that the million and a half Jews which have survivedâbeware and beware againâwill be submitted to the same [fate] as those before. We felt safe in Poland also, we also did not see the danger, and we had much to regret that we didn't work for the land of Israel. But now we must apply all strengths, all possible means, even illegal means; there even was a case when we were asked whether we would go there by way of Cyprus.</span>

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
