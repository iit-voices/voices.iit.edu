And for two weeks laying around on the railroad station literally between the rails since all the Germans had fled and all roling stock was taken. A crowd of twenty thousand people were abandoned, they did not feed us and we existed just how one could manage.</span>

But we tried by hook and crook to avoid it and so we did not go to dig the trenches. After that they left us to the mercy of the fate, but when the last detatchments, a kind of demolishing squad, were leaving who used to blow up the stations they gave us a chance to assemble open cattle cars. And by means of these . . . on these . . . open cars they loaded us, attached a small locomotive, a switching engine from <a class="placename" href="#vothL362">Kretingen</a> to <a class="placename" href="#vothL363">Memel</a>, eighteen kilometers, they transported us in twelve hours. It must be stated that the whole time during our evacuation from <a class="placename" href="#vothL129">Riga</a> to <a class="placename" href="#vothL134">Berlin</a> there was a large and very strict guard, so if somebody only attempted to escape they treated him very cruelly. He was beated and there were even cases that they [the would-be escapees] were killed. Well, and about the events after we were brought to <a class="placename" href="#vothL134">Berlin</a> I have already told. We were brought to <a class="placename" href="#vothC122" type="camp">Wilhelmshafen</a> to the so-called transit <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> which has three yardsâthe first yard, there one only spends one night; they they lead [the people] to the second yard, and [afterwards] to the third, the innermost one.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
