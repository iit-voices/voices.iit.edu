In spite of the fact that France realized that she [?] was not ready for war, we still never thought that there was such a difference in strength between Germany and France. At the beginning of the war, in 1939, we were in contact only with the German fortifications in the <a class="placename" href="#vothL263">Saar district</a> and with the German materielle. This materielle appeared to us not of very high quality; and possibly it was so. But the Germans used during this war completely new tactics, and they had such an abundance of this materielle that the French army was very soon decimated and the whole people and the whole country found themselves in a state of complete moral confusion.<note n="3"><span class="note">The Germans launched their long-awaited offensive against France on May 10, 1940. Due to the failure of French military thinking and planning and, as Mr. Bramson indicates, the superiority of German military tactics, they rapidly advanced. On June 21, 1940, Marshal Philippe Pétain, an aged World War I hero who had become head of the French government, agreed to an armistice signaling a catastrophic defeat for his country.</span><sup><a href="#note_3">3</a></sup></note></span>

Officially, that is openly, it did not exist, openly there was a common front, but on the inside there were constant intrigues, and many ugly things were occurring, inappropriate for such a period [of history]. Moreover, it happened in France, what unfortunately, was bound to happen by the logic of events. The best elements of the Resistance were at the head of military elements. And as the heads of these military elements they were fighting at the front. At the same time the whole administrative machinery was taken over by secondary elements. This resulted in the weakening of the influence of the forces of the Resistance, the weakening of the moral force which was represented by these elements [of the Resistance]; and the worst of it was that these [secondary] elements had joined the movement in the last moment, and did not see in the whole situation anything more than an opportunity for a most successful career . . .<note n="60"><span class="note">It is true that following the liberation there were, as Mr. Bramson notes, internal political struggles within the Resistance. However, the major political struggle at the time was between de Gaulle's provisional government and those elements of the Resistance which sought to retain their independent authority. De Gaulle strove to bring all elements of the Resistance under his authority. In the immediate postwar years, staunch members of the Resistance were also frustrated that their idealistic expectations following the victory over fascism were not fulfilled.</span><sup><a href="#note_60">60</a></sup></note></span>

The Resistance provided significant aid in this campaign of liberation, but the liberation of France could not have been accomplished without Allied military might.

            Kovno is a large city in central Lithuania, which before World War I was part of the Russian empire. At the time of the first Duma, it was a district capital. Kovno was a Jewish cultural and spiritual center with a large Jewish population.

            Leonty Bramson first began his association with ORT in 1909. In the wake of the communist revolution, he left Russia in 1920 and worked in Western Europe on behalf of the organization. He became the president of ORT in 1923 and remained in this position until his death in France in 1941. The International ORT Committee headed by Bramson established branches in the United States, Canada, South America and South Africa. These accomplishments and others were carried out in the face of many obstacles, including the worldwide Great Depression of the early 1930s and the growth of virulent anti-Semitism.

            The Germans launched their long-awaited offensive against France on May 10, 1940. Due to the failure of French military thinking and planning and, as Mr. Bramson indicates, the superiority of German military tactics, they rapidly advanced. On June 21, 1940, Marshal Philippe Pétain, an aged World War I hero who had become head of the French government, agreed to an armistice signaling a catastrophic defeat for his country.

            As Mr. Bramson indicates, during the first two years of German rule the majority of the French population did not actively oppose the Vichy collaborationist government and the occupation. Mr. Bramson was indeed a striking exception.

            The French military general staff anticipated that the main German offensive would come through Belgium whereas the major thrust of the German attack was further south through the supposedly impassable Ardennes. The rapid German advance caught the French by surprise and resulted in the devastating losses Mr. Bramson describes. He was indeed fortunate to be able to reach Compiègne, northeast of Paris.

            The French attempted to establish a defensive front along the Somme River, but by this time the war was nearly lost. The Germans breached French lines on June 7, 1940 and on June 14 they entered Paris. Mr. Bramson fought on as the French army retreated south to the Loire River and then even further south to the city of Limoges. It was near that city that he learned that France had signed a humiliating armistice.

            The provinces of Alsace and Lorraine had been annexed to Germany after the disastrous French defeat in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71. They were regained by France after the German defeat in World War I. There was a well-established Jewish population in these provinces.

            In fact, in 1939 there were about 300,000 Jews in France—about 190,000 of whom were French citizens and the rest foreign. Most of the latter were eastern European immigrants. More than 20,000 Belgian and Dutch Jewish refugees entered France after the war began, and the Germans expelled some 6,500 Jews from southern Germany into France after the latter's defeat. These Jews were sent to Vichy French internment camps.

            <a name="note_13"></a>
            Mr. Bramson's uncle and his family were among the massive wave of refugees who fled south from the advancing Germans. Vichy, a famous spa and the city where the parliament of the defeated French Third Republic was dissolved, became the headquarters of the collaborationist French government under Marshal Pétain. It was therefore understandable that organizations such as ORT and the OSE would be based in Vichy.

            At the outbreak of the war, France controlled the countries of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia in North Africa. The desire of Mr. Bramson and some other young military men to continue the struggle against the Germans from North Africa is indicative of their patriotic determination and martial spirit.

            Périgueux is located in the rural Dordogne region of southwestern France. It lies between the cities of Bordeaux and Limoges. The resistance group Mr. Bramson refers to might be the southern resistance movement, Libération-sud, founded by Emanuel d'Astier.

            As the year 1942 progressed, the attitude of the French population towards the Vichy regime became more hostile, and more hoped to see an Allied victory.

            By this time, the Germans were pressuring the Vichy government to send French workers to Germany, which was facing an increasing manpower shortage. Eventually, on February 16, 1943, the Vichy government was forced to introduce a compulsory labor service, which conscripted French young men to work in Germany. This development did much to undermine support for the regime and helped secure recruits for the Resistance.

            As the occupation progressed, the hostility of significant segments of the French peasant population towards the Vichy regime grew into active cooperation with the Resistance. In a number of areas on France, peasants supplied food, clothing and hiding places to members of the Maquis.

            Following the infamous Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942, the Nazis began to prepare for the deportation of Jews from France and other western European countries to extermination centers in Poland. On June 11, 1942, a key meeting took place in Berlin to arrange for regular deportations to extermination centers. Spearheaded by the French police, roundups of Jews in France took place throughout the summer and fall of 1942 in both the occupied and unoccupied zones of the country. Foreign Jews in France were special targets of these actions, but as time went on, native-born French Jews increasingly found themselves in danger.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_26"></a>
            The most cruel and extensive operation took place on July 16-17 in Paris where some 13,000 Jews—including 7,000 families with small children—were rounded up by French police and deported. Approximately 42,500 French Jews were sent to Nazi annihilation centers, principally Auschwitz, during 1942. One-third of this number were from the unoccupied zone. However, rescue networks, such as the one with which Mr. Bramson was involved, and spontaneous acts of courage by ordinary French men and women, saved many Jews from deportation.

                <li>
            <a name="note_27"></a>
            Boder's confusion is understandable. The German word "lager" was usually used by interviewees to describe Nazi concentration, extermination, or labor camps. Here Bramson uses it in the literal sense ("camp") to describe the base of operations for the Maquis.

            The hydra was often used to symbolize the supposed Jewish, communist, and Freemason conspiracy to rule the world. It was the product of ignorance, bigotry, hatred and paranoia.

            The misfortunes Mr. Bramson is referring to were results of the anti-Semitic legislation promulgated by the Vichy regime and its German overlords.

            In fact, close to 76,000 Jews were deported from France including those, like Mr. Bramson, deported as resisters. Only about 2,500 returned alive. Mr. Bramson is among the fortunate handful who did. Approximately 12% of French Jews and more than 41% of foreign Jews in France were murdered during the Holocaust.

            It should be noted that there was never any attempt on the part of the French resistance to free Jews on deportation trains bound for extermination centers.

            The "army of resistance and French liberation" about which Mr. Bramson speaks was composed of non-communist resistance groups, specifically the Libération-sud movement to which he belonged and two others which formed the nucleus of the so-called Secret Army to which Mr. Bramson later refers. Jean Moulin, de Gaulle's agent in France, helped inspire the unification of these groups into the United Movements of Resistance (Mouvements Unis de la Résistance, or MUR).

            The "militia" was the infamous milice, a French fascist paramilitary organization composed of many virulent anti-Communists and anti-Semites. Its newspaper, "Combats" (not to be confused with the previously mentioned "Combat") was devoted to defending "Christian civilization" from its supposed enemies. The milice murdered several prominent French Jews in cold blood. The number of those in the milice was closer to 30,000 than to 40,000.

            It is unclear as to what "Germer" refers to and whether the "Germer" was a French or German elite police unit although it appears to have been the former.

            After the liberation, General de Gaulle sought to curb the power of the resistance groups and reassert state supremacy. In some cases, such as the one cited by Mr. Bramson, a former resistance leader became a prefect. In a number of others, de Gaulle's representatives assumed local power.

            Bramson is referring to Georgians. ("Gruziya" is the Russian name for Georgia.) Roughly 700,000 Georgians fought against the Nazis as part of the Red Army during the war. However, a number of Georgians also fought for the Nazis as part of the Georgian Legion, a regiment formed in 1941 that consisted of Georgians who emigrated to Western Europe after the Soviet invasion of Georgia in 1921, along with Georgian prisoners of war from the Red Army.

            The Sicherheitsdienst (also called SD, or Security Service) was an intelligence organization which served the SS and the Nazi party. At the outbreak of the war the Gestapo were brought into the same overall Nazi police organization as the SD, so the barbaric SD torturers who inflicted so much pain on Mr. Bramson could also be viewed as officers of the Gestapo.

            The Nazi racist ideology incorrectly viewed the Jews as a "race" when in fact they are members of a religion and a people. Mr. Bramson uses this racist terminology common at the time. The camp at Compiègne, located in north central France, was founded in December, 1941. As he later relates, it was from Compiègne that Mr. Bramson was deported to Buchenwald.
        </li>

            By this time, Algeria was under the control of Free French forces, and General Rommel's German army had been defeated by the English and Americans in Tunisia.

            Initially, there were Jews who were held at Compiègne and suffered greatly from horrible conditions there. This occurred in December 1941 during a reprisal action. Subsequently, as Mr. Bramson indicates, Drancy, a transit camp located in a northern suburb of Paris, became the key transportation point for Jews to annihilation camps in Poland, mainly Auschwitz.

            Buchenwald was established in 1937, and up the end of 1938 the camp's capos were largely criminal prisoners. When these capos became involved in corrupt practices, the SS removed the criminal prisoner capos from their posts, and gradually political prisoners were able to take over the camp's internal administration under SS supervision.

            There were several resistance groups formed in Buchenwald on the basis on nationality, among them the French resistance group about whom Mr. Bramson speaks. By 1943, these groups united in a general underground movement called the International Underground Committee.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_49"></a>
            It was believed by some that Buchenwald had a gas chamber, but this has not been substantiated. However, even though prisoners were not killed by gas, they were murdered in other ways: beatings, tortures, phenol injections, shootings and strangulation. There was an execution chamber beneath the crematorium where victims died by being hung from meat hooks suspended from the ceiling. It is possible that this execution by suffocation is what Mr. Bramson heard about.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_50"></a>
            That is, after D-Day, June 6, 1944. This account of the execution of an Allied airman has not been substantiated. However, there were Allied airmen held at Buchenwald for some months, and some did in fact perish there.

            <a name="note_52"></a>
            Buchenwald had over 130 satellite camps where prisoners were ruthlessly exploited doing slave labor. Mr. Bramson worked in one of them, which was an armaments factory. Many larger German businesses profited obscenely from prisoner slave labor in this and other camps.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_53"></a>
            The liberation of Buchenwald took place on April 11, 1945. By this time, the underground was in control of the installation. The liberating Americans found 21,000 prisoners, including about 4,000 Jews and several hundred Jewish children. One of them was Moses Lau, who went on to become a chief rabbi in Israel.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_54"></a>
            Before the arrival of American forces, the SS evacuated prisoners of various nationalities from the main camp and the satellite camps on what became death marches.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_55"></a>
            One estimate is that the number of prisoners from the Buchenwald main camp and satellite camps who perished on the death marches was in excess of 25,000.

                <li>

            He possibly refers to Schrobenhausen. Both Freising and Schrobenhausen are located in southern Germany between Munich and Regensberg.

            <a name="note_57"></a>
            This is just an example of cases where prisoners were little informed about doings in other parts of the same concentration camp. In fact, there were Jewish men sent to Buchenwald in the wake of the Kristallnacht pogrom, November 9-10, 1938. A number of Hungarian Jews were sent to Buchenwald in 1944, but the largest Jewish influx into the camp occurred in the wake of the Russian 1945 winter offensive which threatened camps in the east. It was then that thousands of Jews, among them Elie Wiesel and his father, Shlomo, were sent to Buchenwald.

            It is true that following the liberation there were, as Mr. Bramson notes, internal political struggles within the Resistance. However, the major political struggle at the time was between de Gaulle's provisional government and those elements of the Resistance which sought to retain their independent authority. De Gaulle strove to bring all elements of the Resistance under his authority. In the immediate postwar years, staunch members of the Resistance were also frustrated that their idealistic expectations following the victory over fascism were not fulfilled.

            Indeed, by the spring of 1944 much of southern rural France was in the hands of the Resistance rather than the Vichy government. However, the Germans still had substantial forces in the area, and the Resistance did not possess the military strength to defeat them in open battle.

            On June 6, 1944 (D-Day), Allied forces landed in Normandy in what was the greatest invasion in military history. Eventually they fought their way into northern France. Local resistance forces provided aid in this operation. On August 15, 1944, Allied troops, including Free French forces, landed on the Riviera and began moving up the Rhone valley. They joined with French troops coming from the north. The Resistance provided significant aid in this campaign of liberation, but the liberation of France could not have been accomplished without Allied military might. The most important contribution of the Resistance to the liberation of France was political and moral.

            From September 1944 until December 1945, General de Gaulle and his cabinet governed France by executive decree. De Gaulle ruled as a kind of benevolent dictator. However, a constituent assembly was elected in the fall of 1945, and the autocratic de Gaulle was soon at loggerheads with it. In January 1946 he abandoned his governmental post and retired to his home in the country.

            The Buchenwald brothel—like those in other camps—was staffed by sex slaves from German occupied countries. At times, German "asocials" such as criminals and communists were assigned to brothels. Brothel clients included SS staff, capos, and prisoners who, as Mr. Bramson indicated, could earn admission.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_65"></a>
            For example, criminals had green triangles, political prisoners had red triangles and homosexuals had pink triangles. Jews had a Star of David consisting of a yellow triangle and a triangle of a different color, for instance red.

            He uses the term "sexualists." This is apparently the word which could not be clearly distinguished in the previous sentences. It is unclear to whom Mr. Bramson is referring when he speaks about sexual deviants, though he might have had male homosexuals in mind. He appears to be referring to male homosexuals here.

            Earlier in his trip Boder had conducted a series of interviews with a number of youths who had been liberated from Buchenwald. These interviews were taken at Chateau de Boucicaut, an OSE home for adolescents in Fontenay-aux-Roses, France, from July 31 to August 2.

            The city of Weimar was associated with the German liberal, humanist tradition and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, one of the giants of world literature, who made his home in Weimar for many years. It gave its name to the German republic which existed from 1918 to the Nazi takeover in 1933.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_70"></a>
            The notorious camp, Dora, where the V-1 rockets were constructed, was a subcamp of Buchenwald.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_71"></a>
            Goethe's Oak in Buchenwald is also mentioned in Boder's interview with Otto Feuer, taken on August 22 in Paris. The stump of Goethe's oak remains as part of the memorial to the camp.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_72"></a>
            Boder is possibly referring here to the seven (or more precisely, eight) months between the destruction of the oak in August 1944 and the liberation of Buchenwald in April 1945.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_73"></a>
            The interview concludes on a triumphant note most fitting for a man who survived so much at the hands of the Germans. Mr. Bramson's hearty laughter reflects the great strength and great luck of a man who surmounted incredible obstacles and lived to tell the tale.

                    The right-wing government of unoccupied France after the country's defeat by the Germans in June 1940, named after the spa town of Vichy, France, where the national assembly was based under Prime Minister Pétain until liberation in 1944. Vichy France was that part of France not occupied by German troops until November 1942. Authoritarian and collaborationist, the Vichy regime cooperated with the Germans even after they had moved to the unoccupied zone in November 1942. It imprisoned some 135,000 people, interned another 70,000, deported some 76,000 Jews, and sent 650,000 French workers to Germany.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.

            Leonty Bramson first began his association with ORT in 1909. In the wake of the communist revolution, he left Russia in 1920 and worked in Western Europe on behalf of the organization. He became the president of ORT in 1923 and remained in this position until his death in France in 1941. The International ORT Committee headed by Bramson established branches in the United States, Canada, South America and South Africa. These accomplishments and others were carried out in the face of many obstacles, including the worldwide Great Depression of the early 1930s and the growth of virulent anti-Semitism.

            The Germans launched their long-awaited offensive against France on May 10, 1940. Due to the failure of French military thinking and planning and, as Mr. Bramson indicates, the superiority of German military tactics, they rapidly advanced. On June 21, 1940, Marshal Philippe Pétain, an aged World War I hero who had become head of the French government, agreed to an armistice signaling a catastrophic defeat for his country.

            The French military general staff anticipated that the main German offensive would come through Belgium whereas the major thrust of the German attack was further south through the supposedly impassable Ardennes. The rapid German advance caught the French by surprise and resulted in the devastating losses Mr. Bramson describes. He was indeed fortunate to be able to reach Compiègne, northeast of Paris.

            The French attempted to establish a defensive front along the Somme River, but by this time the war was nearly lost. The Germans breached French lines on June 7, 1940 and on June 14 they entered Paris. Mr. Bramson fought on as the French army retreated south to the Loire River and then even further south to the city of Limoges. It was near that city that he learned that France had signed a humiliating armistice.

            In fact, in 1939 there were about 300,000 Jews in France—about 190,000 of whom were French citizens and the rest foreign. Most of the latter were eastern European immigrants. More than 20,000 Belgian and Dutch Jewish refugees entered France after the war began, and the Germans expelled some 6,500 Jews from southern Germany into France after the latter's defeat. These Jews were sent to Vichy French internment camps.

            Mr. Bramson's uncle and his family were among the massive wave of refugees who fled south from the advancing Germans. Vichy, a famous spa and the city where the parliament of the defeated French Third Republic was dissolved, became the headquarters of the collaborationist French government under Marshal Pétain. It was therefore understandable that organizations such as ORT and the OSE would be based in Vichy.

The desire of Mr. Bramson and some other young military men to continue the struggle against the Germans from North Africa is indicative of their patriotic determination and martial spirit.

            By this time, the Germans were pressuring the Vichy government to send French workers to Germany, which was facing an increasing manpower shortage. Eventually, on February 16, 1943, the Vichy government was forced to introduce a compulsory labor service, which conscripted French young men to work in Germany. This development did much to undermine support for the regime and helped secure recruits for the Resistance.

            Following the infamous Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942, the Nazis began to prepare for the deportation of Jews from France and other western European countries to extermination centers in Poland. On June 11, 1942, a key meeting took place in Berlin to arrange for regular deportations to extermination centers. Spearheaded by the French police, roundups of Jews in France took place throughout the summer and fall of 1942 in both the occupied and unoccupied zones of the country. Foreign Jews in France were special targets of these actions, but as time went on, native-born French Jews increasingly found themselves in danger.

            The most cruel and extensive operation took place on July 16-17 in Paris where some 13,000 Jews—including 7,000 families with small children—were rounded up by French police and deported. Approximately 42,500 French Jews were sent to Nazi annihilation centers, principally Auschwitz, during 1942. One-third of this number were from the unoccupied zone. However, rescue networks, such as the one with which Mr. Bramson was involved, and spontaneous acts of courage by ordinary French men and women, saved many Jews from deportation.

            Initially, there were Jews who were held at Compiègne and suffered greatly from horrible conditions there. This occurred in December 1941 during a reprisal action. Subsequently, as Mr. Bramson indicates, Drancy, a transit camp located in a northern suburb of Paris, became the key transportation point for Jews to annihilation camps in Poland, mainly Auschwitz.

            Buchenwald was established in 1937, and up the end of 1938 the camp's capos were largely criminal prisoners. When these capos became involved in corrupt practices, the SS removed the criminal prisoner capos from their posts, and gradually political prisoners were able to take over the camp's internal administration under SS supervision.

            There were several resistance groups formed in Buchenwald on the basis on nationality, among them the French resistance group about whom Mr. Bramson speaks. By 1943, these groups united in a general underground movement called the International Underground Committee.

            It was believed by some that Buchenwald had a gas chamber, but this has not been substantiated. However, even though prisoners were not killed by gas, they were murdered in other ways: beatings, tortures, phenol injections, shootings and strangulation. There was an execution chamber beneath the crematorium where victims died by being hung from meat hooks suspended from the ceiling. It is possible that this execution by suffocation is what Mr. Bramson heard about.

            Buchenwald had over 130 satellite camps where prisoners were ruthlessly exploited doing slave labor. Mr. Bramson worked in one of them, which was an armaments factory. Many larger German businesses profited obscenely from prisoner slave labor in this and other camps.

            The liberation of Buchenwald took place on April 11, 1945. By this time, the underground was in control of the installation. The liberating Americans found 21,000 prisoners, including about 4,000 Jews and several hundred Jewish children. One of them was Moses Lau, who went on to become a chief rabbi in Israel.

            This is just an example of cases where prisoners were little informed about doings in other parts of the same concentration camp. In fact, there were Jewish men sent to Buchenwald in the wake of the Kristallnacht pogrom, November 9-10, 1938. A number of Hungarian Jews were sent to Buchenwald in 1944, but the largest Jewish influx into the camp occurred in the wake of the Russian 1945 winter offensive which threatened camps in the east. It was then that thousands of Jews, among them Elie Wiesel and his father, Shlomo, were sent to Buchenwald.

            It is true that following the liberation there were, as Mr. Bramson notes, internal political struggles within the Resistance. However, the major political struggle at the time was between de Gaulle's provisional government and those elements of the Resistance which sought to retain their independent authority. De Gaulle strove to bring all elements of the Resistance under his authority. In the immediate postwar years, staunch members of the Resistance were also frustrated that their idealistic expectations following the victory over fascism were not fulfilled.

            On June 6, 1944 (D-Day), Allied forces landed in Normandy in what was the greatest invasion in military history. Eventually they fought their way into northern France. Local resistance forces provided aid in this operation. On August 15, 1944, Allied troops, including Free French forces, landed on the Riviera and began moving up the Rhone valley. They joined with French troops coming from the north. The Resistance provided significant aid in this campaign of liberation, but the liberation of France could not have been accomplished without Allied military might. The most important contribution of the Resistance to the liberation of France was political and moral.

            From September 1944 until December 1945, General de Gaulle and his cabinet governed France by executive decree. De Gaulle ruled as a kind of benevolent dictator. However, a constituent assembly was elected in the fall of 1945, and the autocratic de Gaulle was soon at loggerheads with it. In January 1946 he abandoned his governmental post and retired to his home in the country.
