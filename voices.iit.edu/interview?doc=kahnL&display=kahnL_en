They were striking and were not cooperating for national defense.<note n="2"><span class="note">In fact, a large part of the blame for France's defeat rests with the outmoded strategic and tactical thinking of the French military, which proved incapable of responding effectively to the Nazi blitzkrieg ("lightning war") techniques, which placed an emphasis on speed and mobility thereby seeking to avoid the trench warfare stalemate of World War I.</span><sup><a href="#note_2">2</a></sup></note></span>

            <span class="utterance" who="#kahnL" start="202.765" end="x">[In French] This is a very important question, in fact, and I would like to respond. I believe that the big problem that caused the difficulties of the war in the beginning and which for years so gravely compromised the world's development, cannot be analyzed simply with the framework of what happened in France. It is unfortunately true that the world community left too large of a burden on the shoulders of the French, in the period between the two wars. When the war ended, everyone went back home and we, the French, we were left face to face with the strength of Germany which was being built up again.<note n="3"><span class="note">Admiral Kahn is alluding to the post World War I isolationist policy pursued by the United States.</span><sup><a href="#note_3">3</a></sup></note> And which was being reconstituted sometimes with the help of its former adversaries.<note n="4"><span class="note">This remark might refer to the 1922 Treaty of Rapallo between Germany and the Soviet Union, which brought about a notable expansion of trade between the two nations but also provided training areas and factories for German armed forces in return for German technical education.</span><sup><a href="#note_4">4</a></sup></note> However, we were much nearer to them, much more exposed. We tried to make the voice of reason be heard. And it wasn't until later that this voice of reason was heard in a useful way, when the danger became a threat for the entire world. This is the real reason for the failures that, through France, the whole world experienced in the first part of the war. And it isn't accurate to place responsibility for them on all or part of the French population. Everyone did the best that they could, in a growing economic crisis, precisely because of the threats of war that, at any given time, would interrupt [corrects himself from saying "political"] the practical work being done.<note n="5"><span class="note">The economic crisis mentioned here is the Great Depression, which struck France with devastating impact in the early 1930s. The Depression helped bring about political instability which was exacerbated by the actions of both right wing and left wing anti-democratic parties and by the growing threat of European fascism.</span><sup><a href="#note_5">5</a></sup></note> And because of constant attempted attacks that the Germans and their agents in France were trying to spread around in order to make things easier for themselves when the time was right. So I'm not surprised that you encountered this propaganda. France was represented as weakened in order to discourage all the powers who would have aligned with her from the very first day, by representing her cause as insufficiently defended by the country herself. And as I meant to say at the beginning, it shouldn't have been France's responsibility alone to carry all the growing weight of the German threat. A peaceful country will always be victimized by a country of murderers. Because the peaceful country will be involved in its peaceful endeavors, while the other freely prepares itself for the business of war, picking the most favorable time to attack, choosing both the most favorable general political circumstances as well as the military circumstances which are particularly favorable to the country who wants to make the first strike. So that is the true cause of the difficulties that the whole world experienced, and we must hope that, enlightened once more by this new threat of a catastrophe, that the world will understand that these catastrophes don't wait until the last minute to give any warning. They can be seen early on by men in positions of authority and they have to have the courage to tell their people the truth so that they can prepare for the crucial moments.<note n="6"><span class="note">Such advice is contrary to the policy of appeasement pursued by Great Britain and France in the crucial years prior to the outbreak of World War II.</span><sup><a href="#note_6">6</a></sup></note></span>

You know that, in France, we have always very liberally welcomed refugees into our country. And it should be acknowledged that if other countries showed themselves to be much more reserved in this type of philanthropic action, France, on the other hand, always considered that it was her duty, as well as her tradition, to be openly welcoming. You should know that the first children who were taken out of the German camps, after much hesitation from other countries, it was France that was first to take them in. France managed to do it despite the extreme difficulties in which she found her economy immediately after Liberation,<note n="7"><span class="note">Indeed, France was very much in need of aid in the wake of World War II. Many of its bridges and railroad facilities had been systematically bombed by the Allies and a number of its ports, such as Brest, Le Havre, Saint-Nazaire, and Toulon had suffered grave damage. Its population had been worn down both physically and psychologically.  Some 2.5 million French men and women had been in captivity in Germany as prisoners of war, forced laborers or concentration camp inmates. More than 200,000 had perished due to the hardships they endured or, in the case of French Jews, were systematically murdered. A number of those incarcerated in Germany who returned home suffered from physical and psychological maladies.</span><sup><a href="#note_7">7</a></sup></note> not only through her own help, but also thanks to the very generous financial aid from numerous countries, among which we must recognize the very generous aid from the United States of America at the top of the list. Never will we forget in France the action taken by the American representatives. The supplies, money and materials that they sent. The devotion with which the representatives of the American armed forces, the <a class="term" href="#vothG_unrra">UNRRA</a> representatives, the representatives of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ajdc">Joint</a> Committee and of numerous other associations freely put together by the good will of your country. No, never will that be forgotten in France. The American generosity, associated with French liberalism, in reality did everything possible in the face of the frightening circumstances the world had never known before, experienced because of veritable forced migrations of men, women and children. And this work is still far from being accomplished. We hope that with your help and our strong determination, we will succeed in overcoming this inconceivable misery suffered by innocent humans who are powerless to help themselves. But we are absolutely sure that when we will have returned to them, with their dignity, the chance to work, they will become not a dead weight for humanity but, on the contrary, an active, intelligent group, molded by the misery they themselves suffered and their own insight, to completely fulfill their human destinies.<note n="8"><span class="note">Though approximately 77,000 French Jews were murdered during the Holocaust, some 250,000 did survive. Thus, the French Jewish community was able to reconstitute itself after the war. This reconstituted community was augmented by roughly 40,000 Holocaust survivors who sought refuge in France after their liberation. Such French Jewish organizations as the Comité juif d'aide sociale et de reconstruction (Jewish Committee for Social Action and Reconstruction) and Oeuvre de Protection des Enfants Juifs (Society for the Protection of Jewish Children) worked assiduously to aid the victims of the Holocaust so that—in the words of Admiral Kahn—they would be able "to completely fulfill their human destinies."</span><sup><a href="#note_8">8</a></sup></note></span>

And the German smiled his sweetest smile and answered them with: "you see, at this time, there is a lot of serious propaganda against the Germans.

How did they take these people? Well, they had already sent many agents to France before the war. And they knew which individuals would oppose their actions. And by any means available, confiscating lists of residents, phone books, using paid traitors. They often used government lists from which they gradually eliminated people using these horrifying procedures of which I only described one small part. As for labor, it was really simple. To have forced labor, they first tried propaganda. They made the French believe that if workers were to leave for Germany, they would be exchanged for prisoners, and thereby the charges and the sentences would be more equally divided between all segments of the population. And in the beginning, with the help of Laval's speech, they were somewhat successful. But very quickly, the French people realized that they had been made to play a frightening role, by purely and simply aiding their horrifying enemy in its war effort. And out of that came the organized resistance to forced labor.<note n="12"><span class="note">Obligatory German labor service was first introduced in France in February 1943 due to growing German labor shortages.

Among its chief duties was the repatriation of displaced persons—when the war ended, UNRRA had to cope with the task of caring for millions of displaced persons and refugees.

            In fact, a large part of the blame for France's defeat rests with the outmoded strategic and tactical thinking of the French military, which proved incapable of responding effectively to the Nazi blitzkrieg ("lightning war") techniques, which placed an emphasis on speed and mobility thereby seeking to avoid the trench warfare stalemate of World War I.

            This remark might refer to the 1922 Treaty of Rapallo between Germany and the Soviet Union, which brought about a notable expansion of trade between the two nations but also provided training areas and factories for German armed forces in return for German technical education.

            The economic crisis mentioned here is the Great Depression, which struck France with devastating impact in the early 1930s. The Depression helped bring about political instability which was exacerbated by the actions of both right wing and left wing anti-democratic parties and by the growing threat of European fascism.

            Indeed, France was very much in need of aid in the wake of World War II. Many of its bridges and railroad facilities had been systematically bombed by the Allies and a number of its ports, such as Brest, Le Havre, Saint-Nazaire, and Toulon had suffered grave damage. Its population had been worn down both physically and psychologically.  Some 2.5 million French men and women had been in captivity in Germany as prisoners of war, forced laborers or concentration camp inmates. More than 200,000 had perished due to the hardships they endured or, in the case of French Jews, were systematically murdered. A number of those incarcerated in Germany who returned home suffered from physical and psychological maladies.

            Though approximately 77,000 French Jews were murdered during the Holocaust, some 250,000 did survive. Thus, the French Jewish community was able to reconstitute itself after the war. This reconstituted community was augmented by roughly 40,000 Holocaust survivors who sought refuge in France after their liberation. Such French Jewish organizations as the Comité juif d'aide sociale et de reconstruction (Jewish Committee for Social Action and Reconstruction) and Oeuvre de Protection des Enfants Juifs (Society for the Protection of Jewish Children) worked assiduously to aid the victims of the Holocaust so that—in the words of Admiral Kahn—they would be able "to completely fulfill their human destinies."

            This statement is similar to a callous and cynical response given by Dr. Joseph Mengele in Auschwitz when asked why he could not spare Jewish children whose mothers had been sent to the gas chambers. He replied that he could not bear to see the children separated from their mothers.

            Obligatory German labor service was first introduced in France in February 1943 due to growing German labor shortages. More than anything else, the introduction of this compulsory labor service ignited a spirit of rebellion among the French population at large and strengthened the French resistance movement.

            Dissatisfaction with the forced labor policy, shortages of food, fuel, and clothing, and clear indications that the Germans were losing the war contributed to greater reluctance on the part of the French population to cooperate with the German occupiers, forcing them to carry out ever more repressive measures such as those described by Admiral Kahn.
