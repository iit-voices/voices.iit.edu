Following the deportations, the attitude of a number in the Church changed. Catholic clerics hid Jews in religious institutions, issued false baptismal certificates and helped Jews fleeing to neutral Switzerland. A number of French Protestants, themselves a small and often beleaguered minority, also became involved in Jewish rescue efforts.</span><sup><a href="#note_10">10</a></sup></note></span>

            In the spring of 1941, Vichy officials ordered the French police to round up mostly foreign-born Jewish men in Paris. Women and children were excluded at the time—Mrs. Goldwasser's arrest was anomalous. Native-born French Jews had a much better chance of survival than did foreign-born Jews such as the Goldwassers.

            She seems to be confusing the dates. It was in August 1941 that Mr. Goldwasser was incarcerated in Drancy.

            The Germans conducted a forcible round-up of Jews in the Paris region—including women and children and people with disabilities—on July 16-17, 1942. Some 9,000 French police were involved in this operation, during which over 12,000 persons (including 3,900 children) were arrested. They were soon taken to Drancy before being deported to Auschwitz.

            The edict mandating the obligatory wearing of the yellow star by all Jews in the German occupied zone was promulgated in May 1942. It provoked a good deal of discontent among the general French population.

            Those arrested in the infamous Paris round-up were at first packed for days without food, water or sanitary facilities in the Velodrome d'Hiver, a Paris sports arena.

            Mischlinge (lit. hybrid) were "half Jews" of the “first or second degree” defined by the Nazi Nuremberg Laws promulgated in the fall of 1935.

            Mrs. Goldwasser's transport held a portion of the 42,500 French Jews who were sent to "an unknown destination" in 1942. In fact, the destination was Auschwitz, where most of the deported were murdered upon arrival. This would have been the fate of Mrs. Goldwasser and her child had she not taken the bold and difficult act of escaping from the train.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_8"></a>
            The Germans did everything possible to keep their victims from knowing that their deportation would end in death. Somehow, Mrs. Goldwasser, perhaps instinctively, realized this and was moved to take desperate action.

                <li>
            <a name="note_9"></a>
            Mrs. Goldwasser was most fortunate in that the Frenchmen she encountered belonged to the Resistance. Some two-thirds of French Jewry survived in France, many due to help such as that offered to Mrs. Goldwasser. These rescuers came from all walks of life. Some were ideologically motivated. Others acted out of a conviction that a fellow human being in danger was deserving of help and compassion. Some of the rescuers knew those they helped and others were introduced to them by third parties. In Mrs. Goldwasser's case, as with many others, help was provided spontaneously to strangers.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_10"></a>
            Prior to the deportations of French Jewry, the French Catholic hierarchy did not protest against Vichy's anti-Jewish measures—many supported the Vichy regime, which had abolished previous anti-clerical legislation and afforded new privileges to the Church. Following the deportations, the attitude of a number in the Church changed. Catholic clerics hid Jews in religious institutions, issued false baptismal certificates and helped Jews fleeing to neutral Switzerland. A number of French Protestants, themselves a small and often beleaguered minority, also became involved in Jewish rescue efforts.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_11"></a>
            Although reliable statistics of Jews in the French Resistance movement are not available, there is little doubt that they were disproportionately represented in the French struggle against their German occupiers. They were found both in the general and the communist resistance. There was also a specifically Jewish resistance movement. It appears that Mrs. Goldwasser was in the general resistance movement, which was tied to the Free French Resistance under General Charles de Gaulle.

            At the time, Spain controlled a portion of northern Morocco from the Atlantic to the Algerian border. On November 8, 1942, Allied forces launched successful landings in French Morocco and Algeria and by May 1943 had driven the Axis powers out of North Africa. These Allied successes encouraged neutral Spain to become more helpful to the Allied cause.

            Jules-Gerard Saliege, the partially paralyzed bishop of Toulouse, authored a ground-breaking pastoral letter on August 30, 1942 which called upon his French countrymen to stand up for the rights of French Jewry and resist the harm being done to them. This letter was read in the majority of churches in the diocese of Toulouse and sold secretly in Catholic book stores. It helped inspire the will to resistance among the Catholic clergy of the area.

            The battle for Paris between the French Resistance and the German army, marked by fierce and bitter street struggles, began on August 17, 1944 and ended with the arrival of the Leclerc division of the Free French forces on August 25 when the remaining German forces surrendered. The SEK portion of the resistance movement, Marseillaise contingent, has not been identified. However, it should not be confused with the SEC, the Vichy Jewish Affairs Commission intended to catch Jews contravening Vichy's anti-Jewish edicts. It is not clear what type of work Mrs. Goldwasser was engaged in with the French military staff. Immediately after the war, resistance groups had a good deal of political power and played a considerable role in the government dominated by General de Gaulle.

            Like most Jews who left Communist bloc countries after World War II, Mrs. Goldwasser's brother was in an UNRRA camp. UNRRA was subordinate to the Allied military commands of each of the four zones of occupation. Munich and the surrounding area, including the Föhrenwald DP camp, were in the American zone. UNRRA's task was to administer the Displaced Persons camps and to oversee the activities of volunteer welfare organizations.

             In keeping with the August 1939 Stalin-Hitler pact, the Russians occupied eastern Poland after the outbreak of World War II and drafted Mrs. Goldwasser's brother into the Red Army. In June 1941, following the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany, the Red Army withdrew and her brother went with it. Some half a million Jews fought in the Red Army during World War II. Approximately 120,000 lost their lives, and thousands more, including Mrs. Goldwasser's brother, were wounded.

            The affidavit was a sworn assurance by family or friends of those who sought to be admitted to the United States that they had the financial means to care for the would-be immigrant and that he or she was at no risk to become "a public charge."

                The camp was opened after a roundup of in Paris Jews in August, 1941, in which over 4000 Jews were arrested.  Drancy was under the control of the French police until July 3, 1943 when Nazi Germany took day-to-day control as part of the major stepping up at all facilities for the mass exterminations.

            In the spring of 1941, Vichy officials ordered the French police to round up mostly foreign-born Jewish men in Paris. Women and children were excluded at the time—Mrs. Goldwasser's arrest was anomalous. Native-born French Jews had a much better chance of survival than did foreign-born Jews such as the Goldwassers.

            The Germans conducted a forcible round-up of Jews in the Paris region—including women and children and people with disabilities—on July 16-17, 1942. Some 9,000 French police were involved in this operation, during which over 12,000 persons (including 3,900 children) were arrested. They were soon taken to Drancy before being deported to Auschwitz.

            Mrs. Goldwasser's transport held a portion of the 42,500 French Jews who were sent to "an unknown destination" in 1942. In fact, the destination was Auschwitz, where most of the deported were murdered upon arrival. This would have been the fate of Mrs. Goldwasser and her child had she not taken the bold and difficult act of escaping from the train.

            The Germans did everything possible to keep their victims from knowing that their deportation would end in death. Somehow, Mrs. Goldwasser, perhaps instinctively, realized this and was moved to take desperate action.

            Mrs. Goldwasser was most fortunate in that the Frenchmen she encountered belonged to the Resistance. Some two-thirds of French Jewry survived in France, many due to help such as that offered to Mrs. Goldwasser. These rescuers came from all walks of life. Some were ideologically motivated. Others acted out of a conviction that a fellow human being in danger was deserving of help and compassion. Some of the rescuers knew those they helped and others were introduced to them by third parties. In Mrs. Goldwasser's case, as with many others, help was provided spontaneously to strangers.

            Prior to the deportations of French Jewry, the French Catholic hierarchy did not protest against Vichy's anti-Jewish measures—many supported the Vichy regime, which had abolished previous anti-clerical legislation and afforded new privileges to the Church. Following the deportations, the attitude of a number in the Church changed. Catholic clerics hid Jews in religious institutions, issued false baptismal certificates and helped Jews fleeing to neutral Switzerland. A number of French Protestants, themselves a small and often beleaguered minority, also became involved in Jewish rescue efforts.

            Although reliable statistics of Jews in the French Resistance movement are not available, there is little doubt that they were disproportionately represented in the French struggle against their German occupiers. They were found both in the general and the communist resistance. There was also a specifically Jewish resistance movement. It appears that Mrs. Goldwasser was in the general resistance movement, which was tied to the Free French Resistance under General Charles de Gaulle.

            At the time, Spain controlled a portion of northern Morocco from the Atlantic to the Algerian border. On November 8, 1942, Allied forces launched successful landings in French Morocco and Algeria and by May 1943 had driven the Axis powers out of North Africa. These Allied successes encouraged neutral Spain to become more helpful to the Allied cause.

            Jules-Gerard Saliege, the partially paralyzed bishop of Toulouse, authored a ground-breaking pastoral letter on August 30, 1942 which called upon his French countrymen to stand up for the rights of French Jewry and resist the harm being done to them. This letter was read in the majority of churches in the diocese of Toulouse and sold secretly in Catholic book stores. It helped inspire the will to resistance among the Catholic clergy of the area.

            The battle for Paris between the French Resistance and the German army, marked by fierce and bitter street struggles, began on August 17, 1944 and ended with the arrival of the Leclerc division of the Free French forces on August 25 when the remaining German forces surrendered. The SEK portion of the resistance movement, Marseillaise contingent, has not been identified. However, it should not be confused with the SEC, the Vichy Jewish Affairs Commission intended to catch Jews contravening Vichy's anti-Jewish edicts. It is not clear what type of work Mrs. Goldwasser was engaged in with the French military staff. Immediately after the war, resistance groups had a good deal of political power and played a considerable role in the government dominated by General de Gaulle.

            Like most Jews who left Communist bloc countries after World War II, Mrs. Goldwasser's brother was in an UNRRA camp. UNRRA was subordinate to the Allied military commands of each of the four zones of occupation. Munich and the surrounding area, including the Föhrenwald DP camp, were in the American zone. UNRRA's task was to administer the Displaced Persons camps and to oversee the activities of volunteer welfare organizations.

In June 1941, following the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany, the Red Army withdrew and her brother went with it. Some half a million Jews fought in the Red Army during World War II. Approximately 120,000 lost their lives, and thousands more, including Mrs. Goldwasser's brother, were wounded.
