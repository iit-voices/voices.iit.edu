What these reasons were we were never able to find out because nobody told us why we were arrested. And the people in power differed to such an extent in status and political outlook that to find any consistent reason for our arrest was absolutely impossible for us. And so this question remains a riddle. We obviously were arrested according to some lists [of names] delivered from varous sources and compiled on different basis. And so, I return [to the previous topic], we were about 500 people Russians in the narrow sense of the word and Jews. and at first we lived under identical conditions and under identical regime, and the treatment accorded us by the German authorities of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> was the same. But that changed comparatively soon. Since the contingent of the arrested as I stated before was most heterogeneous in its political convictions, so there appeared in our midst among the Russians, in the narrow sense of the word, some individuals who presented to the German Command a memorandum that they do not want to be imprisoned together with Jews. Obviously these people had in mind to get in the good graces [of the Germans].<note n="10"><span class="note">Among the Russian emigrés, there were those who were extreme anti-Semites, spreading the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion which described a supposed worldwide Jewish conspiracy to use nefarious means to undermine Christian civilization with the aim of ruling the world.</span><sup><a href="#note_10">10</a></sup></note></span>

And in our section, where there were five [Russian] university professors and two French university professors we soon started to give lectures. In the morning we delivered serious lectures, and in the evening [lectures] of more popular nature. We started to teach languages. We taught French, German, Italian, Spanish, English, and Russian. Every Sunday we organized a concert. We organized a wonderful church for there were in our midst also artists, of course the Germans soon deprived us of our church hall, claiming to need it for the storage of potatoes. To be sure, a week after our church was devastated they deposited there three sacks of potatoes.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="odinetsD" start="1582.669" end="x">There were three priests among us. One of them a very old man who wore fetters and was a great faster. He arrived in times past from Soviet Russia, and failing to be interested in any worldly affairs he did not bother to exchange his Soviet passport. Apparently he was arrested on account of his passport. For what reason the other priests were arrested remains a matter of conjuncture. One of them was apparently arrested for secretly helping the Jews, by issuing to them certain church certificates, which he expected would save them form arrest and imprisonment. And, so I repeat, from the start the regime was not too bad. But things were getting worse, gradually worse and worse. Gradually new, stricter rules were introduced. But these regulations fell with special impact upon the Jews [in our camp]. They became a group apart not in terms of location but in terms of the treatment accorded to them. For instance when a German commission would arrive for investigation [of the status of the internees] the Jews were the last to be called. No promises of any sort were given to them. But at first there were cases when prisoners were set free. And from the start, sixteen Jews were released and in proportion a larger number of Russians were released. In the month of August, at the end of the month, I, ill from malnutrition, was transfered to a hospital [name not clear] where I underwent a very serious operation, followed by several months in bed, without moving. When I left the hospital, after a measure of improvement I found among the internees a most horrible regime. We were not sick but crushed by the imprisonment. And again the worst sufferers were the Jews. In my capacity as an elected prison <a class="term" href="#vothG_trusty">trusty</a> I represented in the hospital the Russians, French, Yugoslavs, and Americans. Only the English had their own representative. And in the capacity of such a representative I had to negotiate with the German authorities on a number of matters pertaining to the prisoners in Van de Grasse [not clear] and among them . . .</span>

One must state here, that among those French forces of resistance were very many Russians. Many of course in proportion to the general number of Russians. And certain [people] among the, not small in number, were presently rewarded military decorations for their demonstrated bravery. Many were killed in battle. The Councils of Liberation were in charge of calling to account of persons who had discredited themselves by collaboration with the Germans. of course often occurred great misunderstandings, especially in the early days when people were apprehended sometimes on sheer suspicion and at times due to dishonest accusations. I personally was heading in those days the legal committee within the newly formed organization the Union of Soviet Patriots. This committee devoted itself to the review of complaints of people who came to it claiming false incarceration or arrest. I must tell that the French authorities heeded to a very high degree to our conclusions, the conclusions of our legal committee, which I was heading. In consequence this committe was able to attain the release of numerous innocent individuals, who were apprehended due to error. But this committee did not occupy itself with extrication of "criminal" elements. We only intervened for those who deserved such intervention.<note n="14"><span class="note">Marshall Pétain and others argued that they had collaborated due to patriotic motives and that theirs had been a benevolent collaboration, which had saved France from what would have been far greater destruction had they not cooperated with the occupiers.

The Jewish religion was prevalent among the ruling strata of the Khazar [?]. In the 7th century the Khazars were a strong and powerful empire, which spread in part over the Caucasus, in part over the lower basin of the Volga. Their prestige was so great that even the Byzantine emperors intermarried with them. The Khazars were zealously proselyting [people] into the Jewish religion.<note n="17"><span class="note">The Khazars were a group of tribes of Turkish ancestry who inhabited a vast territory in southern Russia north of the Caucasus mountains. They converted to Judaism in the year 740 C.E. In about the year 960 C.E., an exchange of letters took place between Hasdai ibn Shaprut (c. 915-c. 975), an important Jewish minister of the Caliph of Cordoba, Spain and Joseph, king of the Khazars. In this letter, Joseph relates how his ancestor, the king Bulan, converted to Judaism. The Khazar ruling elite followed suit, and Judaism by degrees came to be accepted by the population at large. In 1016 C.E., the kingdom of the Khazars was crushed by the Russians and the Byzantines. What became of the Khazars remains a matter of dispute. Some might have been among the forebears of Polish and Russian Jewry.

It was a reply also of his financial adviser. These documents were found in 1912 in the synagouge in <a class="placename" href="#vothL556">Cairo</a>. And so when Ibn-Shaprut asked Joseph how did it come to happen that in the distant east there is a kingdom of true believers who profess the true faith, the faith of the Jews. To this Joseph answered with an historical legend: It happened once that the Khazars found themselves in a very difficult strategic position, and here there appeared an unknown youth—an experienced military leader who beat off the enemy. This youth was of Jewish faith and the victory made such an impression that the whole upper strata [of the khazars] have adopted the Jewish religion. So says Tzar Joseph of the Khazars [Footnote: See remarks at the end of the chapter.]. Exact information on this question is not available.<note n="19"><span class="note">It should be emphasized that this is indeed a legend.</span><sup><a href="#note_19">19</a></sup></note></span>

As an historian I might say that among the American historians there are a great many names of world significance. Personally I became acquainted with the eminent historian Shotwell [??]—the head editor of a publication of many volumes undertaken by the Carnegie Institute on "Influence of War on the Life of a Country." In the case of us the Russian scientists with reference to Russia [I was commissioned to write] a book on the subject: the lower and middle level schools under the impact of the war between the years 1914-1918. Shotwell made upon me the finest impression as a genuine representative of scientific thought and as an exceptionally fascinating person.</span>

            In July 1917, the Provisional government for which Professor Odinets worked passed a law stating that national minorities, such as the Ukrainians, were recognized as a having a right to national autonomy. Thus Professor Odinets was concerned above all, as he said, with combating right wing Ukrainian chauvinism, which would have led to the formation of a separate state.

            The Skoropadsky government, which had been sponsored by the German occupiers of Ukraine during World War I, fell with the defeat of Germany on November 11, 1918. Following this, rival groups of various political persuasions struggled for power. During this time, some 100,000 Ukrainian Jews were murdered in pogroms by Ukrainian nationalist extremists, White Army anti-communist forces, and Poles.

            In the aftermath of the defeat of anti-communist forces, some one million refugees fled from Russia. Several hundred thousand settled in France, among them Professor Odinets, who like others, sought to preserve his Russian identity.

            Ivan Turgenev (1818-1883) was master Russian novelist as well as playwright and poet. He acquired an international reputation as a result of his brilliant portrayals of Russian life. During the 1870s Turgenev lived in Paris where he was an esteemed unofficial Russian cultural ambassador.

            Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852) was a Russian novelist and dramatist whose works were characterized by stylistic richness and sympathetic realism. His writings served as a model for later
                        Russian writers and helped establish the great tradition of the Russian novel.

            Alfred Rosenberg (1893-1946) was the Nazis' leading ideologist. His thinking, incorporating racism, occultism, German neo-paganism, anti-Semitism and anti-Communism, was contained in his influential 1930 work Der Mythus des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts (The Myth of the Twentieth Century). From 1933-1945, he headed the Nazi party's foreign affairs department. After the fall of France, the so-called Operational Staff Rosenberg confiscated French cultural treasures.

            Here, as elsewhere, Professor Odinets shows himself to be free of anti-Semitic sentiments. He expresses genuine sympathy for the plight of the Jews in France during the Occupation and highlights the worse treatment given them.

            Among the Russian emigrés, there were those who were extreme anti-Semites, spreading the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion which described a supposed worldwide Jewish conspiracy to use nefarious means to undermine Christian civilization with the aim of ruling the world.

            Indeed, a French interventionist force arrived in Ukraine shortly after the November 11, 1918 armistice with Germany with the aim of supporting anti-Communist forces. However, the French withdrew their forces in the spring of 1919.

            During the Occupation, there was a vicious cycle of reprisals for acts taken by the Resistance, followed by counter-reprisals and so on. The Germans highlighted that those they executed were communists and Jews in an attempt to show the population at large that these "anti-French" and "foreign" elements were the ones causing problems, and that if not for them, the occupation would be less harsh.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_13"></a>
            Professor Odinets does not further specify what he meant by "patriots of their native land."

                <li>
            <a name="note_14"></a>
            Marshall Pétain and others argued that they had collaborated due to patriotic motives and that theirs had been a benevolent collaboration, which had saved France from what would have been far greater destruction had they not cooperated with the occupiers. When General Charles de Gaulle assumed power following the liberation, he helped to destroy this myth.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_15"></a>
            These acts were part of the first phase of uncontrolled retribution by the Resistance during which many accused collaborators were summarily executed and women accused of fraternizing with the German occupiers were publicly humiliated. Subsequently, investigations and trials of accused collaborators took place.

            The Khazars were a group of tribes of Turkish ancestry who inhabited a vast territory in southern Russia north of the Caucasus mountains. They converted to Judaism in the year 740 C.E. In about the year 960 C.E., an exchange of letters took place between Hasdai ibn Shaprut (c. 915-c. 975), an important Jewish minister of the Caliph of Cordoba, Spain and Joseph, king of the Khazars. In this letter, Joseph relates how his ancestor, the king Bulan, converted to Judaism. The Khazar ruling elite followed suit, and Judaism by degrees came to be accepted by the population at large. In 1016 C.E., the kingdom of the Khazars was crushed by the Russians and the Byzantines. What became of the Khazars remains a matter of dispute. Some might have been among the forebears of Polish and Russian Jewry. However, it is generally accepted that Russian Jewry were of central European origin.

            Odinets is referring to the so-called Radanites, intrepid Jewish traders in the ninth century C.E. who exchanged goods from the Frankish kingdom of Europe for those of Asia. Their name probably comes from a Persian phrase meaning, "knowing the way."

            In July 1917, the Provisional government for which Professor Odinets worked passed a law stating that national minorities, such as the Ukrainians, were recognized as a having a right to national autonomy. Thus Professor Odinets was concerned above all, as he said, with combating right wing Ukrainian chauvinism, which would have led to the formation of a separate state.

            The Skoropadsky government, which had been sponsored by the German occupiers of Ukraine during World War I, fell with the defeat of Germany on November 11, 1918. Following this, rival groups of various political persuasions struggled for power. During this time, some 100,000 Ukrainian Jews were murdered in pogroms by Ukrainian nationalist extremists, White Army anti-communist forces, and Poles.

            Alfred Rosenberg (1893-1946) was the Nazis' leading ideologist. His thinking, incorporating racism, occultism, German neo-paganism, anti-Semitism and anti-Communism, was contained in his influential 1930 work Der Mythus des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts (The Myth of the Twentieth Century). From 1933-1945, he headed the Nazi party's foreign affairs department. After the fall of France, the so-called Operational Staff Rosenberg confiscated French cultural treasures.

            During the Occupation, there was a vicious cycle of reprisals for acts taken by the Resistance, followed by counter-reprisals and so on. The Germans highlighted that those they executed were communists and Jews in an attempt to show the population at large that these "anti-French" and "foreign" elements were the ones causing problems, and that if not for them, the occupation would be less harsh.

            Marshall Pétain and others argued that they had collaborated due to patriotic motives and that theirs had been a benevolent collaboration, which had saved France from what would have been far greater destruction had they not cooperated with the occupiers. When General Charles de Gaulle assumed power following the liberation, he helped to destroy this myth.

            These acts were part of the first phase of uncontrolled retribution by the Resistance during which many accused collaborators were summarily executed and women accused of fraternizing with the German occupiers were publicly humiliated. Subsequently, investigations and trials of accused collaborators took place.

            The Khazars were a group of tribes of Turkish ancestry who inhabited a vast territory in southern Russia north of the Caucasus mountains. They converted to Judaism in the year 740 C.E. In about the year 960 C.E., an exchange of letters took place between Hasdai ibn Shaprut (c. 915-c. 975), an important Jewish minister of the Caliph of Cordoba, Spain and Joseph, king of the Khazars. In this letter, Joseph relates how his ancestor, the king Bulan, converted to Judaism. The Khazar ruling elite followed suit, and Judaism by degrees came to be accepted by the population at large. In 1016 C.E., the kingdom of the Khazars was crushed by the Russians and the Byzantines. What became of the Khazars remains a matter of dispute. Some might have been among the forebears of Polish and Russian Jewry. However, it is generally accepted that Russian Jewry were of central European origin.
