His parents didn't have any news of what happened to him and he returned maybe a year later, by escaping from a train car that was taking him to Germany. He escaped by pulling up a plank in the floor of the car . . . but a friend who was following him lost his legs during [their escape?] From that time on, I tried to leave <a class="placename" href="#vothL236">Marseille</a>. But my . . . determination . . . I was only definitively resolved to leave when the Old . . . when the Germans destroyed the Vieux Port. The Germans claimed that . . . "terrorists", as they called them, were hiding in the Vieux Port.<note n="6"><span class="note">Between January 22 and January 27, 1943, more than 10,000 French police and several thousand German police engaged in the operation to destroy the Vieux Port, the old central harbor and market section of Marseille. This operation displaced 22,000 people and completely demolished this section of the city. Like other German undertakings, this illustrated the ruthlessness and brutality of the Occupation.</span><sup><a href="#note_6">6</a></sup></note> They tried to blow up those old neighborhoods, which were obviously full of little winding streets and . . . pieces of land where . . . that [the Germans] greatly dreaded [they couldn't control]. There . . . it wasn't . . . we . . . one day . . . we were not told what they were plotting. And then one day, while going into central <a class="placename" href="#vothL236">Marseille</a>, we lived on a street . . . rather distant from the Vieux Port . . . while going into central <a class="placename" href="#vothL236">Marseille</a>, we heard the alarm go off. We saw people hastily leaving their homes with their meager baggage, or some were carrying sick children, and were throwing whatever they could onto pushcarts . . . and were still arrested and I only learned recently that five thousand people out of the thirty or forty thousand who had only fifteen minutes to evacuate their homes . . . five thousand of these people were taken and deported to Germany. On that day, we saw arrests, they were putting people . . . we saw people being loaded in paddy wagons. We saw these poor women holding out their arms and trying to hang on to the bars. Seeing these things tore my heart apart, thinking of what could obviously happen to my children. I had only one thing on my mind: to leave <a class="placename" href="#vothL236">Marseille</a>.<note n="7"><span class="note">During these January days, some 6,000 people were arrested in Marseille. Though half were released, the rest were imprisoned in Marseille and deported to the detention center at Compiègne, from where many were sent "to the East" for extermination.

Thousands of Jews in France sought refuge in the benevolently-ruled Italian zone. In September 1943 when Italy capitulated and joined the Allies, the immunity of Jews in this zone evaporated.</span><sup><a href="#note_8">8</a></sup></note> My children were in boarding school in the mountains, and that was when . . . that was when I heard the message: "I've arrived" from my husband in England. In reality, it took him quite a while before he could get the message through. It was this message . . . his message to tell us that he was waiting for us.<note n="9"><span class="note">There is a discrepancy here between Mrs. Kahn's account and that of her son, Jean, who claimed that the family heard the message from Admiral Kahn in December 1942, while still in Marseille.</span><sup><a href="#note_9">9</a></sup></note> After that, I started looking for a way to catch up with him. And I of course had a lot of acquaintances from way back. I was privileged, constantly warned by friends that they . . . while I was still in <a class="placename" href="#vothL236">Marseille</a>, and they had told me that on that evening my neighborhood was going to be searched, go spend the night at the home of some friends.<note n="10"><span class="note">Mrs. Kahn, a member of a respected and well-established French Jewish family, was indeed fortunate to have a number of friends and acquaintances who helped her. Many foreign Jews in France during the Occupation lacked these contacts, and thus they were more vulnerable to arrest and deportation.</span><sup><a href="#note_10">10</a></sup></note> This happened to me several times. But naturally, this was extremely dangerous for these friends. And I am very . . . well, at that time, when I left <a class="placename" href="#vothL236">Marseille</a>, I preferred to have ID cards under another name. I had to . . . find someone to make new ID cards. It was rather difficult because the Resistance printed cards for workers and not for women and children, generally speaking. So it was very difficult to obtain food vouchers for women and children. And so I . . . I found I had the best reception from people from the Resistance whom I didn't know from Adam but simply sent "a word" [Translator's note: could mean "a note" or perhaps a "pass word"?]. In fact, I didn't even get the word from them, I was just given a name and an address, and that so-and-so knew me, I wasn't told the exact name. These people took me in, gave me the keys to their house, where I lived for eight to ten days, long enough to produce false ID cards for me. I didn't go out of the house because I didn't have an ID. I was afraid every second of being stopped in the street. But I stayed in their home for eight days, I stayed at their home for eight days, where I was fed, I . . . they gave me their best room and the keys. Once I had my false ID cards, I could travel.<note n="11"><span class="note">Mrs. Kahn's account once again highlights the importance of having well-forged identification papers which would allow their bearer to travel freely. It appears that before she and her children actually made the crossing into Spain she had traveled to Perpignan to find guides to take them across.

Finally I found others . . . When we talked about getting us out of the country . . . but each time I spoke of my youngest son who was . . . he was only ten at the time, they energetically opposed taking him, saying "this boy won't walk all the way, he won't be able to make it through the mountains, he'll get us caught, etc . . ."<note n="12"><span class="note">Jean was twelve or thirteen at the time, old enough to try to make the escape.

With the . . . energy of my eldest son who prepared everything, he chose our itinerary carefully, using a compass which was an extremely difficult instrument to find at that time. We had found a bunch of Boy Scout compasses that were all more or less usable. We tried out a great many of them before finding one that truly pointed North. We had an enormous amount of trouble to also find road maps, of course, which is . . . we were . . . everyone believed they were being watched, followed, when we went to purchase a map of the Spanish border. He [my son] made these decisions with a lot of drive, which were even more remarkable coming from a boy who was fifteen at the time. And who had never had any real physical training, and it was he who guided us, dragged us along, pushed us through the mountains and never got us lost, using only a compass and the map that we didn't dare take out because of the bad weather. We were always on the right path. And we could say that we crossed the border with probably fewer incidents than if we had gone with a professional smuggler. We took a route that was probably easier, more accessible.

            That is, World War I. Mrs. Kahn entered a profession unusual for a woman at that time.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_2"></a>
            As Abraham Schramack, Mrs. Kahn's father noted, St. Etienne was where the Kahn family resided.

            The Germans abrogated the armistice agreement of June 1940 by occupying the Vichy zone of France on November 11, 1942.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_4"></a>
            She means December 25.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_5"></a>
            Beginning on January 22, 1943, German and French police arrested Jews in Marseille whether native-born or foreign. Since the relative immunity of native-born French Jews from arrest and deportation had ended, the Kahns were in grave danger.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_6"></a>
            Between January 22 and January 27, 1943, more than 10,000 French police and several thousand German police engaged in the operation to destroy the Vieux Port, the old central harbor and market section of Marseille. This operation displaced 22,000 people and completely demolished this section of the city. Like other German undertakings, this illustrated the ruthlessness and brutality of the Occupation.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_7"></a>
            During these January days, some 6,000 people were arrested in Marseille. Though half were released, the rest were imprisoned in Marseille and deported to the detention center at Compiègne, from where many were sent "to the East" for extermination. Not one of the 800 Jews deported from Marseille to Compiègne on January 24, 1943 ever returned.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_8"></a>
            Grenoble, located in southeastern Alpine France about 64 miles southeast of Lyon, was at the time in the Italian-occupied zone of France. Thousands of Jews in France sought refuge in the benevolently-ruled Italian zone. In September 1943 when Italy capitulated and joined the Allies, the immunity of Jews in this zone evaporated.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_9"></a>
            There is a discrepancy here between Mrs. Kahn's account and that of her son, Jean, who claimed that the family heard the message from Admiral Kahn in December 1942, while still in Marseille.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_10"></a>
            Mrs. Kahn, a member of a respected and well-established French Jewish family, was indeed fortunate to have a number of friends and acquaintances who helped her. Many foreign Jews in France during the Occupation lacked these contacts, and thus they were more vulnerable to arrest and deportation.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_11"></a>
            Mrs. Kahn's account once again highlights the importance of having well-forged identification papers which would allow their bearer to travel freely. It appears that before she and her children actually made the crossing into Spain she had traveled to Perpignan to find guides to take them across. This attempt was unsuccessful.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_12"></a>
            Jean was twelve or thirteen at the time, old enough to try to make the escape. However, Mrs. Kahn's father was in his seventies and would not have been physically capable of undertaking the difficult journey. This is why she speaks about trying to save her children and not her father.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_13"></a>
            Mrs. Kahn considered her country at the time was more truly represented by the Free French forces of General De Gaulle with which her husband was fighting.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_14"></a>
            What Mrs. Kahn possibly means here is that they were oblivious to the difficulties they would encounter on the trip.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_15"></a>
            These and other small acts of kindness were instrumental in helping the Kahns. It should not be forgotten that even during the years of the Holocaust, there were human beings who showed themselves capable of generous and humane behavior.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_16"></a>
            Paris had been liberated on August 25, 1944, less than two months before Mrs. Kahn arrived.

            Beginning on January 22, 1943, German and French police arrested Jews in Marseille whether native-born or foreign. Since the relative immunity of native-born French Jews from arrest and deportation had ended, the Kahns were in grave danger.

            Between January 22 and January 27, 1943, more than 10,000 French police and several thousand German police engaged in the operation to destroy the Vieux Port, the old central harbor and market section of Marseille. This operation displaced 22,000 people and completely demolished this section of the city. Like other German undertakings, this illustrated the ruthlessness and brutality of the Occupation.

            During these January days, some 6,000 people were arrested in Marseille. Though half were released, the rest were imprisoned in Marseille and deported to the detention center at Compiègne, from where many were sent "to the East" for extermination. Not one of the 800 Jews deported from Marseille to Compiègne on January 24, 1943 ever returned.

            Grenoble, located in southeastern Alpine France about 64 miles southeast of Lyon, was at the time in the Italian-occupied zone of France. Thousands of Jews in France sought refuge in the benevolently-ruled Italian zone. In September 1943 when Italy capitulated and joined the Allies, the immunity of Jews in this zone evaporated.

            There is a discrepancy here between Mrs. Kahn's account and that of her son, Jean, who claimed that the family heard the message from Admiral Kahn in December 1942, while still in Marseille.

            Mrs. Kahn, a member of a respected and well-established French Jewish family, was indeed fortunate to have a number of friends and acquaintances who helped her. Many foreign Jews in France during the Occupation lacked these contacts, and thus they were more vulnerable to arrest and deportation.

            Mrs. Kahn's account once again highlights the importance of having well-forged identification papers which would allow their bearer to travel freely. It appears that before she and her children actually made the crossing into Spain she had traveled to Perpignan to find guides to take them across. This attempt was unsuccessful.

            Jean was twelve or thirteen at the time, old enough to try to make the escape. However, Mrs. Kahn's father was in his seventies and would not have been physically capable of undertaking the difficult journey. This is why she speaks about trying to save her children and not her father.
