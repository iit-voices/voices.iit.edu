Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.

                    The German term meaning ‚ÄúMuslim.‚Äù The term applied to prisoners in camps close to dying from starvation and exhaustion. Their skeletal faces were devoid of expression, and they¬†seemed to have been overcome by despair and by the absence of the will to live. The origin of the term has not been definitively established, though it has been attributed to a certain similarity to a prostrate Muslim in prayer.
