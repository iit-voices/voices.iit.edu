    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "0.423","u": "[In English:] Spool 117. Bellevue, a suburb of Paris. A home of displaced children. September 7, 1946. [Incorrect date -- should be Spetember 8]. We are going to interview Mr. Joseph Ferber, 33 years old, a teacher of sports and a general instructor at the school for displaced children under the direction of Miss Lena Kuechler. "},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "33.451","u": "[In Yiddish:] And so, Mr. Ferber, would you tell me again where you are from and where you were when the war began?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "43.500","u": "I was born in Brody, on the former Austro-Russian border. Later the town belonged to Poland. There I went to school, gymnasium [middle-level schools] and then I went to Cracow, where I was working until the year 1939."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "66.717","u": "At what were you working?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "68.061","u": "As a bookkeeper."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "69.514","u": "Hm."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "70.311","u": "When the German-Polish war began I returned to Brody. There I...the Soviets had come there on the seventeenth of September, 1939. Under them I also worked as a teller in a bank, as inspector, and then also as a bookkeeper."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "93.670","u": "And so tell me, Mr. Ferber, how did that suddenly change from the Polish government to the Soviet? Did they immediately install in your place the whole Soviet regime?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "111.560","u": "No. Following the escape in September, during the war, of the Polish government to Rumania, the Soviet government declared that all political and diplomatic relations between them are terminated. On the 17th of September the Red Army received an order to march into West Ukraine and West White Russia in order to liberate the people who were living there as a part of the people of Great Ukraine and of White Russia. After the Soviets were there a month they made a plebiscite, elections. The elections took place in all cities, towns, and villages. Then in Lemberg, during the assembly of all the elected deputies, it was decided to turn to the highest council of Soviet Russia with the request that these countries should be recognized as a part of Soviet Russia. And by this procedure these countries were accepted into the Soviet Union, and they became recognized as part of the country. [Pause.]"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "148.808","u": "Go on."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "149.511","u": "Well, [the conditions] there were quite good. One cannot say that it was not good. Social justice was established. Everybody had to work. Large private fortunes, factories, and large estates became nationalized; that means were transferred as property of the state. Everybody had to go to work. Everyone had a right to work, everyone had a right to an education. The Jews had every right, not like it was before under the Polish government where Jewish students in the universities used to be beaten with sticks and pummeled, where there were many victims. Now everyone had equal rights and equal chances for a life. "},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "225.059","u": "The Poles, however, still remained there in Poland. Did they express any anti-Semitism?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "234.918","u": "The majority of such rabid Poles who had been planted there by the Polish government that they should polonize the land were taken out deep into Russia. And the rest had to sit quietly. They waited until the war started on June 22, 1941."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "256.026","u": "Hm."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "256.745","u": "At that time, on the first day, I was drafted into the Red Army. At that time, one can say, emerged anew all those Polish anti-Soviet elements which, in the first days of the war, carried out sabotage, who had shot [sniped] from the windows and from the roofs at the...at our...at the Red army, so that there was a great chaos and the Red Army had to retreat. Retreated far, until, until Stalingrad. I, too, went with the Red army as far as Stalingrad, and there I have been during the whole time . During all that time I took part in the heavy battles, for which I also received a medal, for the defense of Stalingrad."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "298.400","u": "How long were you in the Red army?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "302.916","u": "I was in the Red army close to four and a half years, since the first day of the war until at this time a year ago when I was released as a former Polish citizen. I was discharged and I went back to Cracow, but before that I had gone through with the Red army, taking part in the offensive. From Stalingrad, we went through all Russia, the Ukraine, and together with the Second Ukrainian front of Marshal Ross... Rokossovsky, no...pardon, Malinovski, I came to...we went through Hungary, through Rumania, through Czechoslavakia and finally Austria. There, on the 9th of May, 1945, we finished the war."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "345.217","u": "Hm. There you were demobilized?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "347.106","u": "No, I was demobilized still later, when I returned to Soviet Russia, to Chernovtsy."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "352.997","u": "Hm."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "353.685","u": "There I was freed. From there I went back to Poland, to Cracow."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "358.278","u": "Did they permit anyone to leave who wanted to?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "360.620","u": "Yes. All former Polish citizens had a right to be set free according to the treaty which was effected by the Soviet and Polish governments, of the 6th of July, 1945."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "373.266","u": "&#39;45."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "374.579","u": "Had a right to return to Poland. On this ground many, many former Polish citizens are even today returning from Soviet Russia to Poland."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "383.329","u": "They are still returning now?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "384.907","u": "Even now there is going on...which is called repatriation."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "388.626","u": "Hm."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "389.079","u": "The great repatriation which is going on even today."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "391.719","u": "They are returning from Siberia and from..."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "393.453","u": "From Siberia...and from whole Russia. All those who were...who had escaped during the war to Soviet Russia and were in the defense deep in the country, all those have remained alive. In contrast, when we were advancing with the offensive, in all the countries, in all the towns where we had passed, where once had lived Jewish masses, we found nobody, only destruction and graves. Often, not even graves, because the majority of the Jews, nearly all without exceptions, also my whole family, all had been taken away either to Belzec, or to Treblinka, or to Auschwitz and to other lagers, where they were burned in the crematories. So that returning home -- I was in my native town -- I did not find anybody."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "436.858","u": "Your native town was what?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "437.945","u": "Brody."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "438.664","u": "Brody?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "439.320","u": "Yes, I did not find anyone there ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "440.399","u": "You found no one there."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "441.117","u": "Even of the house not a trace had remained. A desert. Everything destroyed, everything burned."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "446.839","u": "Was there...was it burned by the war?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "450.672","u": "Partly by the war and partly through...during the occupation. The Germans simply destroyed everything that carried a Jewish mark. Besides that the front had stood there four months, from spring...the entire spring of 1944, and everything...everything was destroyed there, all the houses. The Germans went systematically from house to house and blasted everything. In many cases it happened that in these houses there were Jews hidden deep underground in bunkers."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "481.935","u": "Hm."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "482.591","u": "And the Germans were not able to drag them out from there. They would toss in grenades or burning strew. Or even with mines they would demolish these houses. In this way many...hundreds of people were entombed [burned] and lie there to this day."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "498.062","u": "Who told you that?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "498.984","u": "This was told to me by a few...a small number of Jews who had remained alive there in the town, Jews who, in an extraordinary manner, had hidden among Christians, but very few. There were altogether about ten of these people. "},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "511.166","u": "And..."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "511.854","u": "People who were in the woods as partisans, they have told me that. Besides that, I saw it with my own eyes, I saw the whole town devastated, destroyed."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "524.253","u": "Nu, what did you do then, when you returned to Brody?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "527.590","u": "Nu, from Brody...in Brody I stopped over only for a few days , because I had nowhere to stay there. The whole town was a cemetery. From there I returned there where I worked before the war. I came to Cracow, but also..."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "538.835","u": " To Cracow."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "539.804","u": "To Cracow, yes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "540.428","u": "Nu?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "541.022","u": "Also in Cracow I found nobody. Then soon I was engaged to work in a children&#39;s home for Jewish orphans in Zakopane as commander of the self-defense [a type of private local underground organization which, dating from the time of the Czar, would emerge in Jewish communities of Eastern Europe, for the purpose of armed resistance against pogroms or other anti-Semitic mob violence. These organizations became quasi-legal during the first year or so after World War II/, because there was a threat of an attack of the anti-Semitic elements against the Jewish children. There we had to stand day and night, I as commander with a number of other soldiers who were demobilized. We got weapons , automatics, grenades, rifles..."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "570.061","u": "Who gave you the weapons?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "571.467","u": "These were given to us by the Polish Defense Authority."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "573.920","u": "Yes?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "574.529","u": "There we had to stand day and night and guard the lives of the Jewish orphans, because there was a threat of great danger. But since this danger increased from day to day and the Poles were throwing down on us leaflets in which they threatened that they will kill us all like they had killed not far from us in Zakopane, in Nowy Targ, the chairman of the Jewish Committee [Community Council]....And they wrote that this same fate will meet all the other Jews who live there. Therefore, we had to flee from there. We..."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "603.345","u": "How is that? The Polish government was a...a pro-Soviet government."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "608.615","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "609.209","u": "They were liberal? They were socialists?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "611.381","u": "The government was and is to this day a very good one. It is a loyal...it is liberal government and a truly democratic one, but, unfortunately, many elements, wild elements, of the people, who are infected by the anti-Semitic disciples of Hitler&#39;s school..."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "641.237","u": "Nu?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "641.831","u": "...who are supported, as it had been proven with documents, by [General] Anders and by the so called government...Polish government in London, these are carrying out to this day an ugly, loaths-...loathsome action [against] the Jews. [They] attack, make pogroms, kill Jews, so that barely a day passes in Poland when there is not a Jewish burnt offering. This is, alas the ugly spot on the body of the new democratic Poland. Naturally the Polish government fights against them, but it is too weak to control these wild beasts. "},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "668.547","u": "Nu, you were in Zakopane with the children&#39;s home?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "672.531","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "673.109","u": " So what was decided to do?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "674.578","u": "It was decided to flee from there as soon as possible. We turned to the Vaad Hatzala. They..."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "681.025","u": "What is that?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "682.118","u": "The Vaad Hatzala is such an organization which rescues Jewish souls. This organization made it possible for the children together with the personnel to leave as former Greek citizens..."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "696.789","u": "Greek citizens?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "699.147","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "699.819","u": "[Chuckle.] Are they Greek?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "700.882","u": "No, but it was made up so [presented that way. We wrote that once there were other refugees which the Germans had dragged off, and that they are returning now to their homes. On the border, on the Polish-Czech border, they created difficulties for us."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "713.606","u": "Who, the Poles of the Czechs?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "715.074","u": "The Czechs."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "715.871","u": "Yes?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "716.621","u": "They wanted to send [us] back to Poland, but we succeeded. We pleaded with them and they permitted [us] to enter Prague. From Prague we journeyed already in good style as far as France. Here we received a house, and here we carry on our work of pedagogical leadership with the children, with the children who are demonstrating very good fruits of the work. "},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "737.917","u": "What will become of the children? What will become of all of you? [Pause.] I mean, what will you all do? Will you remain in France?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "742.776","u": "No, our aim is to come to Eretz Yisroeil, [?] to Palestine, because we are convinced that we have no other place on this earth except in our own homeland. There we hope we will not be looked upon as foreign citizens. There it will not be said that we are homeless Jews. So we, too, have to our own home. That is the basis of the school."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "791.800","u": "Our standpoint is as follows: We hold that, as all the people in the world have their own piece of ground in the world, so the Jews must have their own piece of ground. We cannot count [depend] on anybody, just as no one wanted to concern himself with us when our brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers were being burned in the crematories. We do not want to displace the Arabs from &#34;Eretz Yisroeil.&#34; We want to live with them in peace; but the muftis and the effendis are leading a campaign against us. We know who they were. They were also good friends, good disciples of Hitler. England, too, has her interests there and does not want to turn over to us Eretz Yisroeil. All that does not scare us. We know that we must wage a struggle so as not to permit that the tragedy which we have gone through during this war, when six million Jews were burned...and that this must never happen again. For that we must also go into battle so as to get our own little piece of ground in the world. We hope that, having survived Haman and Hitler, we shall survive various other [sarcastically:] English gentlemen who do not want to recognize our right to live."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "870.374","u": "What does it mean &#39;we have survived Haman and Hitler&#39;? Millions of people did not survive Hitler."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "877.327","u": "Millions did not survive, but the people as such has remained and will remain. Because a people is immortal. Individual persons may die. Haman, too, as well as Hitler have disappeared. Even Churchill had...had to step aside, and we hope that Attlee and Bevin, too, will step aside, and England will have to recognize our right, as the whole world has to recognize our right, to Eretz Yisroeil. "},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "903.484","u": "Nu, and what does one do here all day?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "905.984","u": "An intensive job is being done here. From morning till night we work with the children."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "913.432","u": "How many children are there here?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "915.072","u": "Now we have sixty children."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "916.743","u": "What are their ages?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "917.931","u": "The children are from four up to fifteen, sixteen years."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "921.603","u": "Tell me one thing. If so many have been annihilated, and women have been annihilated, from where did you get small children? You are already how long from Zakopane? How old is the children&#39;s home in Zakopane?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "935.846","u": "It is already over a year since our children&#39;s home was established."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "939.565","u": "And so, from where did the small children come?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "942.611","u": "Many children have survived for the reason that good [kind] Christians had taken them in and have not minded that they themselves were in danger of being killed if such a child were found with them. They would hide these children, would hide the children under the beds, under [in] cupboards, on roofs [attics], in cellars. Many children remained alive for the reason that they had escaped to the forests and fields, and there they hid. Many children did not admit to being Jewish children. They had that much intelligence, and they were admitted by the Poles into various children&#39;s homes and monastaries [also convents/. There they were brought up."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "981.771","u": "And so, do you think that the monastaries and convents hid children who [because they] said they were not Jewish? [Pause.] Do you think that the monastaries would not have hidden Jewish children if they knew it?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "994.923","u": "No. If they would have known that they are Jewish children, perhaps they would not have hidden them."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "998.579","u": "But with boys it was possible to know."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "1001.236","u": "No, they were not too strongly controlled. They were not too strongly controlled. They would see a child, so it was admitted. The child would not say anything. It did not want to say that it has Jewish parents, so they would think that perhaps it is a Christian child. For the most part, little girls hid in this way. The boys, there were even such who were partisans. Besides that, we have such children who had been carried out from the burning ghetto during the uprising in Warsaw. They had been carried out and carried out to the Christian side, to the Aryan side, and there they would hide out. Only a few days before we left Zakopane we found out by accident that these children...there were five such Jewish children who were in Zakopane in a Polish children&#39;s home. So we brought them back from there and the children returned to our fold, to our national fold."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1051.626","u": "What is an Ochronka? [We had used this term, hence the question.] "},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "1053.470","u": "An Ochronka is a children&#39;s home, in Polish."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1056.205","u": "They were in a Polish children&#39;s home."},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "1058.830","u": "Yes, in a Polish children&#39;s home."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1060.049","u": "And so, you had found out...what does it mean, &#39;they were bought back&#39;?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "1064.896","u": "We simply had to pay a price for them, to pay money for them, a certain sum of money, a very large one even, and besides that, to give a lot of products [food] and things, foodstuffs and victuals for that, that the children had been feed [by them] for three, four years, or two years.

And this, in fact, is the quintessence, that everyone is drawn to the place where he was born. Because in fact, from my own experience, in Russia the Jews have it, indeed very good. On the whole one cannot complain. The concept of anti-Semitism does not exist there. But every man is drawn to the place where he was born. This is simply such a sentiment. And besides that, this has to be taken into account. Every man...I had many friends from Cracow who returned, because they owned homes there, they had large possessions. And occasionally they also succeed in getting it back, but on the other side, it sometimes leads again to [becoming] victims, for the reason that the Poles, seeing a Jew returning who says,&#39;This was my house.

On the ruins which we find we do not want to build any more. When we come and find a burned home, a destroyed workshop, seeing that we have lost everything, everything that was dear was killed, we do not want to build any more on these ruins. And because of that the Jew thinks, if to start building, it is better to build in his own homeland, in one&#39;s own land. This is one [reason]. And the second -- it is the unceasing danger which threatens. This is the peril to one&#39;s life. Because in Poland, as I have said before, exists a strong reactionary force which is committing murder and acts of death on every Jew that they chase in the street or even in his own home.

And we are working for an idea [ideal], to raise again children in order that they grow up to be good, fine people. These children love us very much, as much as one loves his own father and his own mother. We have a case where relatives of these children who live in America have contacted the children. They sent them papers and asked that the children should come to them, and the children decline it. The children say there where our head mistress will go, where our teachers will go, where our upbringers will be, there we want to be together with them, and all of us together have only one thought and one idea, to go to Eretz Yisroeil."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1654.506","u": "Nu, when you will come to Eretz Yisroeil, will you distribute the children to families, or will you keep them again together?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "1662.431","u": "We will strive to live again in Eretz Yisroeil again in one community, which goes under the name of Kibbutz."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1668.078","u": "Kibbutz, nu?"},    {"who": "Joseph Ferber", "start": "1669.610","u": "But, children, we know, always go their own way.

Because the facts show that a private life has many more faults than a collective life. We see, for instance, that to our children the concept of egoism is completely alien. In them egoism became completely discarded. We never see an instance when a child should....If a child gets something, something from a friend, a toy or something to eat, the child always shares with all the other children. There never happen incidents that one child should want more, or another child should want less. The children are living under truly just, social ideals. This is the great plus [asset] in our work. This, indeed, raises our courage for our further work, to go on raising these children in a social and democratic spirit.

When we hear the name Jew, or when we happen to meet on the street a Jew, there awakens in our [hearts] a great mass of really deep feelings. And for this reason, too, our sentiments for Jewry are much greater than previously. And today, when we hear that in America lives a large number of Jews who work and earn and have a free life, we would wish them to remember us, too, that they should always remember that we, today, when we have nothing -- we only have good martyrs, good...a strong will and good strivings -- that these brothers of ours in America should help us, be it morally and be it materially.

                    <p class="utterance">I was born in Brody, on the former Austro-Russian border. Later the town belonged to Poland. There I went to school, gymnasium [middle-level schools] and then I went to Cracow, where I was working until the year 1939.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">When the German-Polish war began I returned to Brody. There I...the Soviets had come there on the seventeenth of September, 1939. Under them I also worked as a teller in a bank, as inspector, and then also as a bookkeeper.</p>
                                                                                                <b>David Boder</b>
                    <p class="utterance">And so tell me, Mr. Ferber, how did that suddenly change from the Polish government to the Soviet? Did they immediately install in your place the whole Soviet regime?</p>
                                                                                                <b>Joseph Ferber</b>
                    <p class="utterance">No. Following the escape in September, during the war, of the Polish government to Rumania, the Soviet government declared that all political and diplomatic relations between them are terminated. On the 17th of September the Red Army received an order to march into West Ukraine and West White Russia in order to liberate the people who were living there as a part of the people of Great Ukraine and of White Russia. After the Soviets were there a month they made a plebiscite, elections. The elections took place in all cities, towns, and villages. Then in Lemberg, during the assembly of all the elected deputies, it was decided to turn to the highest council of Soviet Russia with the request that these countries should be recognized as a part of Soviet Russia. And by this procedure these countries were accepted into the Soviet Union, and they became recognized as part of the country. [Pause.]</p>

                    <p class="utterance">Well, [the conditions] there were quite good. One cannot say that it was not good. Social justice was established. Everybody had to work. Large private fortunes, factories, and large estates became nationalized; that means were transferred as property of the state. Everybody had to go to work. Everyone had a right to work, everyone had a right to an education. The Jews had every right, not like it was before under the Polish government where Jewish students in the universities used to be beaten with sticks and pummeled, where there were many victims. Now everyone had equal rights and equal chances for a life. </p>

                    <p class="utterance">The Poles, however, still remained there in Poland. Did they express any anti-Semitism?</p>

                    <p class="utterance">The majority of such rabid Poles who had been planted there by the Polish government that they should polonize the land were taken out deep into Russia. And the rest had to sit quietly. They waited until the war started on June 22, 1941.</p>
                                                                                                <b>David Boder</b>

                    <p class="utterance">At that time, on the first day, I was drafted into the Red Army. At that time, one can say, emerged anew all those Polish anti-Soviet elements which, in the first days of the war, carried out sabotage, who had shot [sniped] from the windows and from the roofs at the...at our...at the Red army, so that there was a great chaos and the Red Army had to retreat. Retreated far, until, until Stalingrad. I, too, went with the Red army as far as Stalingrad, and there I have been during the whole time . During all that time I took part in the heavy battles, for which I also received a medal, for the defense of Stalingrad.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">I was in the Red army close to four and a half years, since the first day of the war until at this time a year ago when I was released as a former Polish citizen. I was discharged and I went back to Cracow, but before that I had gone through with the Red army, taking part in the offensive. From Stalingrad, we went through all Russia, the Ukraine, and together with the Second Ukrainian front of Marshal Ross... Rokossovsky, no...pardon, Malinovski, I came to...we went through Hungary, through Rumania, through Czechoslavakia and finally Austria. There, on the 9th of May, 1945, we finished the war.</p>

In contrast, when we were advancing with the offensive, in all the countries, in all the towns where we had passed, where once had lived Jewish masses, we found nobody, only destruction and graves. Often, not even graves, because the majority of the Jews, nearly all without exceptions, also my whole family, all had been taken away either to Belzec, or to Treblinka, or to Auschwitz and to other lagers, where they were burned in the crematories. So that returning home -- I was in my native town -- I did not find anybody.</p>

They would hide these children, would hide the children under the beds, under [in] cupboards, on roofs [attics], in cellars. Many children remained alive for the reason that they had escaped to the forests and fields, and there they hid. Many children did not admit to being Jewish children.

                    <p class="utterance">No, they were not too strongly controlled. They were not too strongly controlled. They would see a child, so it was admitted. The child would not say anything. It did not want to say that it has Jewish parents, so they would think that perhaps it is a Christian child. For the most part, little girls hid in this way. The boys, there were even such who were partisans. Besides that, we have such children who had been carried out from the burning ghetto during the uprising in Warsaw. They had been carried out and carried out to the Christian side, to the Aryan side, and there they would hide out. Only a few days before we left Zakopane we found out by accident that these children...there were five such Jewish children who were in Zakopane in a Polish children&#39;s home. So we brought them back from there and the children returned to our fold, to our national fold.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">Every Jew hopes that he will still find someone at home, that he will perhaps find his house, his belongings, or something else. And this, in fact, is the quintessence, that everyone is drawn to the place where he was born. Because in fact, from my own experience, in Russia the Jews have it, indeed very good. On the whole one cannot complain. The concept of anti-Semitism does not exist there. But every man is drawn to the place where he was born. This is simply such a sentiment. And besides that, this has to be taken into account. Every man...I had many friends from Cracow who returned, because they owned homes there, they had large possessions. And occasionally they also succeed in getting it back, but on the other side, it sometimes leads again to [becoming] victims, for the reason that the Poles, seeing a Jew returning who says,&#39;This was my house. This was my dwelling. These are my possessions&#39;...so they go and kill such a Jew because they do not want to return his possessions which they had grabbed at the time when the Germans were there.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">Something else is to be considered here. On the ruins which we find we do not want to build any more. When we come and find a burned home, a destroyed workshop, seeing that we have lost everything, everything that was dear was killed, we do not want to build any more on these ruins. And because of that the Jew thinks, if to start building, it is better to build in his own homeland, in one&#39;s own land. This is one [reason]. And the second -- it is the unceasing danger which threatens. This is the peril to one&#39;s life. Because in Poland, as I have said before, exists a strong reactionary force which is committing murder and acts of death on every Jew that they chase in the street or even in his own home. An example of this is the pogrom which took place at this time a year ago in Cracow and a month ago in Kielce, where from the Shaarith Hapleta [that is, from a few hundred remaining Jews] ...</p>

And we are working for an idea [ideal], to raise again children in order that they grow up to be good, fine people. These children love us very much, as much as one loves his own father and his own mother. We have a case where relatives of these children who live in America have contacted the children. They sent them papers and asked that the children should come to them, and the children decline it. The children say there where our head mistress will go, where our teachers will go, where our upbringers will be, there we want to be together with them, and all of us together have only one thought and one idea, to go to Eretz Yisroeil.</p>

                    <p class="utterance"> [Pause.] Yes. Because the facts show that a private life has many more faults than a collective life. We see, for instance, that to our children the concept of egoism is completely alien. In them egoism became completely discarded. We never see an instance when a child should....If a child gets something, something from a friend, a toy or something to eat, the child always shares with all the other children. There never happen incidents that one child should want more, or another child should want less. The children are living under truly just, social ideals. This is the great plus [asset] in our work. This, indeed, raises our courage for our further work, to go on raising these children in a social and democratic spirit. [Pause.]</p>

                    <p class="utterance">To the American Jews and to the American workers, as our brothers, we have only one message. When we hear the name Jew, or when we happen to meet on the street a Jew, there awakens in our [hearts] a great mass of really deep feelings. And for this reason, too, our sentiments for Jewry are much greater than previously. And today, when we hear that in America lives a large number of Jews who work and earn and have a free life, we would wish them to remember us, too, that they should always remember that we, today, when we have nothing -- we only have good martyrs, good...a strong will and good strivings -- that these brothers of ours in America should help us, be it morally and be it materially. And our work will be for them our best gratitude.</p>
