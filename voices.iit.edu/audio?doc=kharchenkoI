At the same time one didn&#39;t feel like leaving Riga going somewhere into the unknown and so with the Germans whom we already had learned to know during their one and a half - two year stay in Latvia and have found out that this is . . . that this is a nation which is exclusively dedicated to aggression and enslavement of mankind, and were compelled kind of, to choose the lessor of two evils. But we had no chance even to do so since the Germans in a compulsory manner made everybody join the evacuation; and after having embarked us in the lagers, and in order that we may not escape from these lagers fenced around by a triple wiring, they hanged on the chest of everybody his own number and the number of the lager and photograped us. After that regardless of his specialty or social status, all were sent to public works and frequently families were broken up&#226;transporting the children and mothers somewhere in one direction and sending the heads of families, the husbands and sons in another direction. And so, when my family was sent away I didn&#39;t know where it was sent in the month of August and only by accident having escaped from this lager I learned that my family was in the city of Auerbach [one word not clear] working in a clothing factory as Ostovzi [apparently a term which he proceeds to explain] that means as compulsory labor, Ostovzi."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1096.215","u": "From the East."},    {"who": "Ioan Kharchenko", "start": "1096.901","u": "Yes, yes, yes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1097.950","u": "Well?"},    {"who": "Ioan Kharchenko", "start": "1099.323","u": "It was called &#34;Ost&#34;."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1102.566","u": "Tell me more detail about the life in the lager, how you were transported, how they treated you, and how you escaped."},    {"who": "Ioan Kharchenko", "start": "1111.979","u": "I personally had to travel not by steamer, but by train, so that I had to travel towards Kovno, in freight cars. From Kovno we were sent to Kretingen and in Kretingen they disembarked us. And for two weeks laying around on the railroad station literally between the rails since all the Germans had fled and all roling stock was taken. A crowd of twenty thousand people were abandoned, they did not feed us and we existed just how one could manage."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1156.822","u": "What does it mean, &#39;How one could manage&#39;?"},    {"who": "Ioan Kharchenko", "start": "1159.821","u": "That means that we led a half hungry existence and were forced in every way on the border of Kretingen to go to work, diging trenches. But we tried by hook and crook to avoid it and so we did not go to dig the trenches. After that they left us to the mercy of the fate, but when the last detatchments, a kind of demolishing squad, were leaving who used to blow up the stations they gave us a chance to assemble open cattle cars. And by means of these . . . on these . . . open cars they loaded us, attached a small locomotive, a switching engine from Kretingen to Memel, eighteen kilometers, they transported us in twelve hours. It must be stated that the whole time during our evacuation from Riga to Berlin there was a large and very strict guard, so if somebody only attempted to escape they treated him very cruelly. He was beated and there were even cases that they [the would-be escapees] were killed. Well, and about the events after we were brought to Berlin I have already told. We were brought to Wilhelmshafen to the so-called transit lager which has three yards&#226;the first yard, there one only spends one night; they they lead [the people] to the second yard, and [afterwards] to the third, the innermost one. And from there, there is no way out, except for being assigned as a chattel slave to one of the German military factories."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1258.254","u": "How did they treat people?"},    {"who": "Ioan Kharchenko", "start": "1259.856","u": "They treated them like animals."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1262.925","u": "Did they beat?"},    {"who": "Ioan Kharchenko", "start": "1263.651","u": "Yes, they used to beat; they fed very poorly and in general there was a state of complete misrule. They forced us to work regardless of hours and they fed us exclusively on turnip&#226;rather on water from under turnips, and they provided no more than a hundred grams of bread a day."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1282.117","u": "Who were the supervisors?

One must say, that there were even cases when our own Russian girls while selling themselves to Germans, obtaining so to speak, some temporary comforts, tried in every way to persecute and oppress their own brothers the Russians; not only the Russians but all the others too; there were there also Latvians, there were there also Lithuanians, there were there also Estonians, there were there also Poles. One must say that the Poles were treated worse of all. Well, one felt badly hurt, when in Wilhelmshafen some Russian little punk of a girl, sixteen-seventeen years old, but enjoying the favors of the head of this lager slapped the face of some aged professor. In the other lagers, however, in the labor-lagers at the factories and plants the supervisors were only Germans and there the discipline was still worse and still more rude. With greater cruelty they treated different trifling offences. It was not permitted to leave the quarters of the very lager, and even if they let one go out to the city once in a month or two, for an hour or two one had no right to ride on a streetcar or on a bus but had to walk in the middle of the street, in the middle of the street on foot."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1375.397","u": "And what kind of clothing did you wear?"},    {"who": "Ioan Kharchenko", "start": "1377.165","u": "We wore our own clothing but only wore a sign, a sign, such a blue sign [badge?] on the chest marked with the white letters Ost."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1385.884","u": "Ost.

There was a friend of mine engineer Korablikov, whom I asked, in case I should not return [to take care of] my little things, which I had, and to forward them to me somehow later.

At the same time one didn&#39;t feel like leaving Riga going somewhere into the unknown and so with the Germans whom we already had learned to know during their one and a half - two year stay in Latvia and have found out that this is . . . that this is a nation which is exclusively dedicated to aggression and enslavement of mankind, and were compelled kind of, to choose the lessor of two evils. But we had no chance even to do so since the Germans in a compulsory manner made everybody join the evacuation; and after having embarked us in the lagers, and in order that we may not escape from these lagers fenced around by a triple wiring, they hanged on the chest of everybody his own number and the number of the lager and photograped us. After that regardless of his specialty or social status, all were sent to public works and frequently families were broken up&#226;transporting the children and mothers somewhere in one direction and sending the heads of families, the husbands and sons in another direction. And so, when my family was sent away I didn&#39;t know where it was sent in the month of August and only by accident having escaped from this lager I learned that my family was in the city of Auerbach [one word not clear] working in a clothing factory as Ostovzi [apparently a term which he proceeds to explain] that means as compulsory labor, Ostovzi.</p>

From Kovno we were sent to Kretingen and in Kretingen they disembarked us. And for two weeks laying around on the railroad station literally between the rails since all the Germans had fled and all roling stock was taken. A crowd of twenty thousand people were abandoned, they did not feed us and we existed just how one could manage.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">That means that we led a half hungry existence and were forced in every way on the border of Kretingen to go to work, diging trenches. But we tried by hook and crook to avoid it and so we did not go to dig the trenches. After that they left us to the mercy of the fate, but when the last detatchments, a kind of demolishing squad, were leaving who used to blow up the stations they gave us a chance to assemble open cattle cars. And by means of these . . . on these . . . open cars they loaded us, attached a small locomotive, a switching engine from Kretingen to Memel, eighteen kilometers, they transported us in twelve hours. It must be stated that the whole time during our evacuation from Riga to Berlin there was a large and very strict guard, so if somebody only attempted to escape they treated him very cruelly. He was beated and there were even cases that they [the would-be escapees] were killed. Well, and about the events after we were brought to Berlin I have already told. We were brought to Wilhelmshafen to the so-called transit lager which has three yards&#226;the first yard, there one only spends one night; they they lead [the people] to the second yard, and [afterwards] to the third, the innermost one. And from there, there is no way out, except for being assigned as a chattel slave to one of the German military factories.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">No, in Wilhelmshafen the supervisors were young Russians who were formerly under the Soviets. One must say, that there were even cases when our own Russian girls while selling themselves to Germans, obtaining so to speak, some temporary comforts, tried in every way to persecute and oppress their own brothers the Russians; not only the Russians but all the others too; there were there also Latvians, there were there also Lithuanians, there were there also Estonians, there were there also Poles. One must say that the Poles were treated worse of all. Well, one felt badly hurt, when in Wilhelmshafen some Russian little punk of a girl, sixteen-seventeen years old, but enjoying the favors of the head of this lager slapped the face of some aged professor. In the other lagers, however, in the labor-lagers at the factories and plants the supervisors were only Germans and there the discipline was still worse and still more rude. With greater cruelty they treated different trifling offences. It was not permitted to leave the quarters of the very lager, and even if they let one go out to the city once in a month or two, for an hour or two one had no right to ride on a streetcar or on a bus but had to walk in the middle of the street, in the middle of the street on foot.</p>

Our request to you is&#226;save us, as once upon a time Minin and Pozharsky [Footnote: Minin and Pozharsky were a merchant and military man, respectively, who called for the redemption of Russia from the yoke of the Tartars in the century. Their famous call &#34;Let us mortgage our women and children but save the land&#34;, has become a traditional patriotic stereotype.] have mortgaged their . . . had given away all their belongings, they even said, that they would mortgage their wives and children and still would save Russia, so you too, Oh, redeem the ruins of that Russia, which for twenty-seven years now is navigating without sails and without rudder on the great ocean of sorrow and blood. Amen!</p>
