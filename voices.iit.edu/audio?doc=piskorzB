    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "10.802","u": "[In English] Spool number 102, Benjamin Piskorz from Warsaw reporting. We are making an experiment now to pick up special episodes rather than to take the whole story. He was a participant in the fights of the Warsaw Ghetto, and that he has chosen to relate [to] us. We . . . we started a spool which . . . eh, went wrong, and we are . . . the first twenty minutes will be repetition which, possibly, will influence the fluency or the details of his story."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "46.996","u": "[In Yiddish] And so, Mr. Piskorz, you saw what happened with the spool. Please start. Tell us your name, and tell us please the story of the entire uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto, the way you personally have experienced it."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "59.676","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "60.218","u": "All right."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "61.070","u": "My name is Piskorz, Benjamin. I was born in Warsaw, and that which I am going to tell you I have lived through and seen with [my] own eyes and felt with my own body. The first happenings, the ones I want to tell you, because the whole story will take a little too long . . . I will begin right away with the transportations, when a few transports of Jews had already been sent away, and we began to organize the Young Fighters. We began organizing the Jewish Fighter Troops. These Jewish Fighter Troops were called Z.P.B. In Polish these initials stand for Jewish Fighter Organization, and which . . . and which had as its aim the fight against the exterminations of the Jews which were going on in Poland till . . . till . . . till the Judenrein [operation Jew-clean, a locality devoid of Jews, a Jew clean-out]. The procurement of weapons from [for?] the party [Polish underground?] was very difficult, because [of] money, the financial position of the organization, was very weak. It was scarcely enough to buy a few pistols for the organization [some words not clear]."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "131.792","u": "From whom did one buy them, the pistols [?]?"},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "135.111","u": "What?"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "135.902","u": "From whom did one buy them, the pistols?"},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "138.249","u": "Oh, yes. The pistols we bought. The comrades who worked in various places of the German troops, for instance, by the SS in the veterans homes, in the ammunition factory. These comrades bought up from the older military men, from the SS, from SS men from the Wehrmacht, from whoever had served in the army in the year &#39;14. These men who were already older people, who remembered that war [1914-17] and what Jews had done for them, these people aided us very much, say with food, with bringing in food to the Ghetto, and with arms. This still wasn&#39;t all. For this we needed finances. The procurement of finances was . . . we procured the finances thus, that we went at night, dressed in black, in black rubber boots, black coats, masks on the faces, and with revolvers in the hand. We went from door to door to Jews, to rich Jews, about whom we knew approximately how much money they had, and we demanded from them money. The money we didn&#39;t always get. But when we threatened with death or with other things, then we got the money. And we offered . . . we left, every time when we took from anybody a sum of money, we left receipts, such receipts so that after the war that particular person should be able to claim from the . . . the fighters, or from other institutions which would be created after the war. And so not all Jews agreed to this. But against threats there was no way out, and they aided with something. For this money we also bought other . . . the things which we needed for the [fighter] units. But in the meantime the organization was created which also went under the name of Z.P.B. which was composed of thieves and people of the Warsaw underworld, also of Jews who went around to procure money in our name. This money went for them, into their pockets. And the money which we procured went for the things needed for our society, the Jews of our organization. And so it happened, a few days before Pesach, in the year &#39;43 it happened that they prepared for a Judenrein in the Warsaw Ghetto."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "308.548","u": "What is a Judenrein?"},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "309.722","u": "Judenrein is a . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "313.432","u": "Extermination process?"},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "314.094","u": "An extermination process against the Jews. To remove the Jews from Warsaw. The Jews . . . the Jews were . . . so the panic in the Ghetto was very great. People in the Ghetto went around like poisoned mice, one can say. And they shouldn&#39;t . . . people prepared themselves. People made various hideouts. People brought food, edibles. People bought and hid it so that one should be able to have food for at least three years, a year, a year and a half. Because according to what was heard from the Germans, from Hitler&#39;s speeches, that at five minutes to twelve . . . should the war end at twelve, [then at] five minutes to twelve all the Jews will be exterminated in . . . in Poland, just like in all the occupied countries that the Germans had envaded. And so people made preparations, that approximately the battle will still take not exactly till twelve, like Hitler said, but it can last half a year, and even a year. So people prepared food for a certain time. The org- . . . the organization also prepared itself, and on the day when the . . . the Judenrein happened, well, on that night&#226;it was on . . . on the first, the fourth month in the year &#39;43&#226;the people have . . . and so the organization prepared the step towards battle. The organization numbered about [a] hundred and seventy people, and in the last two days the number came up close to two hundred. All were provided in the way of weapons, ammunition, clothes. In the middle of the battle . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "414.205","u": "What kind of clothes?"},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "415.418","u": "Well, the SS clothing, because even inside the Ghetto, deep inside the Ghetto, there was a shop, a factory of German clothing. The factory was named Brauer. In the factory . . . the factory . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "428.757","u": "Wasn&#39;t it dangerous to walk around in an SS uniform? Couldn&#39;t another Jew take one for a real SS man."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "435.437","u": "And so it was. It was dangerous, but at night when nobody saw, we sneaked out. And that clothing . . . we hid them . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "443.258","u": "I mean one Jew shouldn&#39;t take the other one for an SS, and he should not . . ."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "449.496","u": "No, no. That wasn&#39;t so, because the people, when it was the . . . when the battle occurred, only Jews were disguised, and those who did know that this is an SS man walking around among Jews, so he is a Jew."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "462.609","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "463.060","u": "Because an SS man didn&#39;t dare to walk around among Jews, because he knew what awaited him."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "467.469","u": "Aha."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "468.205","u": "Yes. And . . . and on that night, when it happened, the . . . when it was supposed to . . . when it happened, the Judenrein . . . it happened on Monday morning, the day which is on the first Seder night. It happened . . . at night our comrades have . . . the comrades of the organization have stood around and around the wall. Because there had been erected around and around the Ghetto a brick wall which had on top three tiers of barbed wire, and [words not clear] one shouldn&#39;t be able to climb over. Underneath that fence also stood weapons, machine guns and also sentries of Ukrainians, of Polish police and gendarmerie."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "512.484","u": "Nu?"},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "514.982","u": "At that night . . . and so when the Judenrein was about to take place, the guard had been doubled. It means it became tripled, not just doubled, but tripled. It was reinforced. And when the . . . our organiz- . . . the comrades from the organization noticed that the guard was reinforced, we prepared ourselves. And we knew that something is happening in the ghetto."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "537.338","u": "Well."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "537.880","u": "The Jews . . . and so the comrades immediately notified, from house to house, notified all Jews who were living [there] that they should hide themselves because tomorrow a Judenrein takes place."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "548.842","u": "A Judenrein means clean-out of Jews."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "552.161","u": "of Jews."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "553.223","u": "Nu?"},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "554.126","u": "The Jews hid themselves, but not all hid themselves. Only young people hid themselves. The older people could not be taken down to the cellar, because for that it was already too late. The people have . . . they went down to the cellars, and one had . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "570.805","u": "Cellars?"},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "571.557","u": "To the cellars, yes. And people have . . . people hid themselves. People went into hiding. And it was indeed true. Right on the next morning, at six o&#39;clock at dawn, immediately arriv- . . . entered German troops, SS with tanks, arti- . . . artillery, cannons, machine guns. And the first attack that the Jews started . . . There was a Jewish . . . a [woman] comrade of our organization who immediately . . . She lived near the entrance gate to the Ghetto. Near the . . . near the wall was a gate through which one could enter the Ghetto and she . . . she had a box with grenades. She had the gendarmerie and the German troops. They were pelted. When the Germans noticed that they were being attacked by the Jews, they surrounded the house in which the [woman] comrade was. The comrade, as she had heroically begun [the attack], so she heroically died. Her . . . her heroism is in this, in the fact that the [woman] comrade once was wounded in the hand from a machine gun bullet, because the Germans made use of dum-dum bullets. These are bullets which tear up the body of the person."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "644.428","u": "Hm."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "645.219","u": ". . . altogether. Whatever substance they hit they explode. And this girl was hit by such a bullet in the hand. She became, here in the arm, torn up so that she couldn&#39;t move her arm any more. When she saw that these are her last moments, she decided . . . she took a revolver and she shot herself."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "665.711","u": "Hm."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "666.292","u": "Herself. She took her own life. And indeed later, the same thing . . . it happened that the comrades, who were supposed to go on a patrol to see where the . . . the Germans were, what they were doing, and when they were doing . . . one did . . . not everyone had the desire to go, because they knew they are going for certain death, but when the name of this [woman] comrade was mentioned he went. And . . . and the . . . the time passed. The Ghetto was bombarded with incendiary bombs, with the gas bombs, with tear gas, in order to get the people out of the hideouts. The Ghetto was completely burned. People saw that the battle will not last longer, we won&#39;t be able to carry out the fight any longer. And so it was decided . . . a proposal was put forth that one should escape from the Ghetto. But how should one escape? It was decided to blow up one wall of the Ghetto, and a few hundred people should pass through and only at the end should the organization . . . the comrades escape. And this plan was indeed executed. A wall was blown up. This is on Platz Muranow where there was the . . . the . . . main square of the small . . . of the Ghetto, that later on also was destroyed [?] in a certain part, was . . . was blown up. A few hundred people, women with children and older people, were thrown through, sent through that . . . through that wall, through that blown up one. A part of these people were killed by the Ukrainians who were standing near the fences, and so on, and were shot. Whoever had luck saved his life, he remained alive. And also, after a certain time&#226;this was already in the fourth month of the battle . . . [correction] in the fourth week of the battle&#226;the comrades decided that one cannot go on fighting any more, that the rest of the comrades who are here should escape. I had in the hideout . . . I had a mother with a cousin. And this mother with the cousin I couldn&#39;t leave behind. So I proposed [that] all the comrades should escape and I will remain with the mother, because, all in all [?], the mother looked like a Jewish child [person belonging to the Jewish &#39;race&#39;], a dark, Jewish woman. She had a Semitic face. And so it wasn&#39;t possible with the mother to escape to the Aryan side, because it would surely be detected. And one heard even about the people who did escape. They are caught. They look like Jews. They don&#39;t have any documents, so they are killed in the Gestapo. So death . . . death is either way. So I proposed that I will remain with the mother. How long I can make the food last? There in the cellar, so we shouldn&#39;t be discovered, so I will remain. After this the comrades escaped, about thirty, forty people,                         through the canals. Through the sewers they escaped to the Aryan side and there to Lublin, the center of the partisans. I remained with the mother. On the seventh of May . . . from the sixth to the seventh of May the people have . . . You see, people walked around at night and searched [for food and friends?] I, too, went out at night with my mother, with the people with whom I was hidden there. With distant relatives I was hidden. And the people have . . . the people asked around, &#39;Where is my mother? Where is my father? Where are my brothers and sisters?&#39; So as to be able to find out. And later it did come out, right the next morning. It was about six, seven in the morning. It was already dawn. There came the gendarmerie, and also among them was a Jew who asked about a father who had been searching at night. That . . . and that same young man denounced us. That is, he showed them where we were hidden."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "886.444","u": "Hm."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "888.972","u": "The Jews . . . the Jews . . . these who were hidden together with me, all had to come out. And so I want to mention here that all my things had been burned. While in the battle I had been dressed [disguised] in SS clothes. During the battle . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "905.200","u": "Why?"},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "905.630","u": "Because various fights had been going on. And so the fights consisted of, for the most part, fights with ambushed patrols. The fight with patrols was thus. At night we went out and ambushed from a few paces the real German patrols. And when we killed them we took off their weapons and their uniforms, and the comrades would put them on. When all my things were burned I didn&#39;t have any other means than . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "932.111","u": "Where had all your things been burned? At what time?"},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "933.986","u": "At home. And so it was burned. And it happened that I remained completely naked [without my regular clothes], and I was in German clothes and didn&#39;t have a change. And at dawn when I was exposed by that Jew&#226;we were pointed out where we were hidden&#226;but I was dressed still in German clothes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "953.193","u": "What did you say before on the other spool that was spoiled, that it was very hot downstairs?"},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "958.979","u": "Yes, yes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "960.033","u": "How . . ."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "961.095","u": "Yes, it is so. At night&#226;I have forgotten to mention it&#226;at night when we went out to catch a little fresh air . . . it was because we were lying in the cellars."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "971.386","u": "In the cellars."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "972.229","u": "We lay in the cellars where we were covered by an entire house. By a five story house we were covered. And the heat . . . the . . . the bricks became heated from the fire what was burning, so that the . . . the ceiling of the cellar had become very hat. And the . . . the heat of the cellar went up to forty, fifty, to sixty degrees [Centigrade?], because the &#39;breath&#39; that we exhaled also thickened the air, and we couldn&#39;t breathe. So that at night we had to get out a little to catch fresh air. And indeed, on the night when we went out we met a young man who asked about a [his] father, about an entire family."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1011.906","u": "Yes?"},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "1012.276","u": "And he mentioned the name. We said that we didn&#39;t know him, and that same &#39;comrade&#39; noticed where we were hiding, and next morning he come in again with gendarmerie and betrayed us. When I came out of the cellar the gendarmerie immediately had me."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1027.803","u": "Have you know him? Did you know who he was?"},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "1029.798","u": "I didn&#39;t know him, because he was not a Jew from Warsaw. And even from Warsaw one can&#39;t know all the Jews."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1035.133","u": "Hm."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "1035.705","u": "And this really was . . . from his pronunciation one recognized that he was a Galitian."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1040.799","u": "Hm."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "1041.371","u": "Because the Galitian Jews have such . . . such a . . . a [peculiar] pronunciation in . . . in Jewish."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1046.495","u": "Hm."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "1047.037","u": "And the Jews that . . . that Jew persuaded us. We should come out. We are going to work [he told us]. He was caught at night. He found an excuse that he was caught this night and he had to show where the Jews were hidden. If not, he was going to be shot. But as we knew from before, all these people who talked that way were the real Gestapo work . . . employees. That Jew promised us that we were going to go to work and nothing would be done to us. When I came out of the cellar I hid the gun that I had and the ammunition in a . . . in a barrel, in a real barrel with water, thrown in. When I came out, I was immediately taken to the side and my hands were manacled. After that . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1085.434","u": "You were in the SS uniform."},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "1087.601","u": "Yes, because I was in the SS uniform."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1089.536","u": "Nu?"},    {"who": "Benjamin Piskorz", "start": "1090.087","u": "Then the Ukrainians built a huge fire of charcoal. They gathered charcoal. They built a huge fire and began asking questions. Where is my family? I didn&#39;t want to disclose that I have family here, [claiming] that the mother is a stranger to me. But my mother spoke up. She thought that I would be . . . that I would be . . . that with this she would save me, if she says that I still have a mother they won&#39;t do anything to me. And so the mother was tied with another few people, among [them] also that cousin, and they were burned alive. I was standing before the fire, approximately twelve to fifteen meters away. Afterwards I was . . . while I was standing my nerves, my whole consciousness became as if entirely lost. What does lost mean? I didn&#39;t know what to do. Around and around have . . . near me stood SS men and guarded me with their weapons. If I take one step forward I will be immediately shot. Should I throw myself on the fire? I am also a dead one, so I have . . . the . . . the . . . I was so . . . I grew into the ground, I can say. I couldn&#39;t [take] one step forwards or one step backwards. I remained standing.

I will watch over you. I will keep you in my hand,&#39; after that, when the mother already began to burn, I was . . . I was thrown by the SS men on a truck and was driven away to headquarters. At the headquarters I was tortured so that I should . . . should tell how many comrades . . . where the comrades were, the comrades from the uprising, the rebells. Where are the comrades? Where are the arms that we had bought? Where are the ammunition magazines? Where are the foodstuffs, and where are the partisans hidden? In what region? I didn&#39;t want to disclose. The tortures . . . the first tortures were . . . where these . . . that a few times a day I was hung on a hook in a wall. My hands were tied in the back and I was hung up on the hands. And so I hung fifteen to twenty minutes. Afterwards I was taken out . . . taken down unconscious from the hook. I was doused with water and hung up again. At night when they were . . . I was kept there for six days. When the . . . the Germans saw they couldn&#39;t do a thing with me, they decided that maybe I will tell if they will torture me differently.

I was born in Warsaw, and that which I am going to tell you I have lived through and seen with [my] own eyes and felt with my own body. The first happenings, the ones I want to tell you, because the whole story will take a little too long . . . I will begin right away with the transportations, when a few transports of Jews had already been sent away, and we began to organize the Young Fighters. We began organizing the Jewish Fighter Troops. These Jewish Fighter Troops were called Z.P.B. In Polish these initials stand for Jewish Fighter Organization, and which . . . and which had as its aim the fight against the exterminations of the Jews which were going on in Poland till . . . till . . . till the Judenrein [operation Jew-clean, a locality devoid of Jews, a Jew clean-out]. The procurement of weapons from [for?] the party [Polish underground?] was very difficult, because [of] money, the financial position of the organization, was very weak. It was scarcely enough to buy a few pistols for the organization [some words not clear].</p>

                    <p class="utterance">Oh, yes. The pistols we bought. The comrades who worked in various places of the German troops, for instance, by the SS in the veterans homes, in the ammunition factory. These comrades bought up from the older military men, from the SS, from SS men from the Wehrmacht, from whoever had served in the army in the year &#39;14. These men who were already older people, who remembered that war [1914-17] and what Jews had done for them, these people aided us very much, say with food, with bringing in food to the Ghetto, and with arms. This still wasn&#39;t all. For this we needed finances. The procurement of finances was . . . we procured the finances thus, that we went at night, dressed in black, in black rubber boots, black coats, masks on the faces, and with revolvers in the hand. We went from door to door to Jews, to rich Jews, about whom we knew approximately how much money they had, and we demanded from them money. The money we didn&#39;t always get. But when we threatened with death or with other things, then we got the money. And we offered . . . we left, every time when we took from anybody a sum of money, we left receipts, such receipts so that after the war that particular person should be able to claim from the . . . the fighters, or from other institutions which would be created after the war. And so not all Jews agreed to this. But against threats there was no way out, and they aided with something. For this money we also bought other . . . the things which we needed for the [fighter] units. But in the meantime the organization was created which also went under the name of Z.P.B. which was composed of thieves and people of the Warsaw underworld, also of Jews who went around to procure money in our name. This money went for them, into their pockets. And the money which we procured went for the things needed for our society, the Jews of our organization. And so it happened, a few days before Pesach, in the year &#39;43 it happened that they prepared for a Judenrein in the Warsaw Ghetto.</p>

And also, after a certain time&#226;this was already in the fourth month of the battle . . . [correction] in the fourth week of the battle&#226;the comrades decided that one cannot go on fighting any more, that the rest of the comrades who are here should escape. I had in the hideout . . . I had a mother with a cousin. And this mother with the cousin I couldn&#39;t leave behind. So I proposed [that] all the comrades should escape and I will remain with the mother, because, all in all [?], the mother looked like a Jewish child [person belonging to the Jewish &#39;race&#39;], a dark, Jewish woman. She had a Semitic face. And so it wasn&#39;t possible with the mother to escape to the Aryan side, because it would surely be detected. And one heard even about the people who did escape. They are caught. They look like Jews. They don&#39;t have any documents, so they are killed in the Gestapo. So death . . . death is either way. So I proposed that I will remain with the mother. How long I can make the food last? There in the cellar, so we shouldn&#39;t be discovered, so I will remain. After this the comrades escaped, about thirty, forty people,                         through the canals. Through the sewers they escaped to the Aryan side and there to Lublin, the center of the partisans. I remained with the mother. On the seventh of May . . . from the sixth to the seventh of May the people have . . . You see, people walked around at night and searched [for food and friends?] I, too, went out at night with my mother, with the people with whom I was hidden there. With distant relatives I was hidden. And the people have . . . the people asked around, &#39;Where is my mother? Where is my father? Where are my brothers and sisters?&#39; So as to be able to find out. And later it did come out, right the next morning. It was about six, seven in the morning. It was already dawn. There came the gendarmerie, and also among them was a Jew who asked about a father who had been searching at night. That . . . and that same young man denounced us.
