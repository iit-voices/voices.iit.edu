Under Kramer, Bergen-Belsen became a concentration camp. The internal management of the camp was placed in the hands of prisoner overseers as was done in other concentration camps. In order to retain their posts or from sheer sadism, a number felt compelled to demonstrate their ruthlessness. Polia's description of the brutal Jewish female functionaries as "Turkish or Romanian" is highly dubious, especially since Turkey was neutral during World War II. It should be noted that after the war Kramer and other SS administrators of the camp, including sixteen women, were tried for their crimes at Belsen. Kramer and eleven others were condemned to death and executed. Nineteen were imprisoned and fourteen were acquitted.</span><sup><a href="#note_14">14</a></sup></note></span>

            Polia here is most probably referring to World War I, since prior to that Staszów was part of Russian-controlled Poland. The Russians were not in Staszów at the start of World War II—it was occupied from the very beginning by the Germans.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_2"></a>
            This is in reference to the Russian conquest of Staszów in the winter of 1944.

            Polia's sentiments here are indicative of those of many survivors who wished to rebuild their lives and reassert their humanity after the trials and tribulations they had been through.

            There were a number of German female SS guards at Belsen who oversaw and tortured the thousands of Jewish female inmates there. Their behavior might have been made worse in part by their desire to impress their male counterparts.

                <li>

            In early December, 1944, Josef Kramer became camp commandant, a post formerly held by Adolf Haas. Under Kramer, Bergen-Belsen became a concentration camp. The internal management of the camp was placed in the hands of prisoner overseers as was done in other concentration camps. In order to retain their posts or from sheer sadism, a number felt compelled to demonstrate their ruthlessness. Polia's description of the brutal Jewish female functionaries as "Turkish or Romanian" is highly dubious, especially since Turkey was neutral during World War II. It should be noted that after the war Kramer and other SS administrators of the camp, including sixteen women, were tried for their crimes at Belsen. Kramer and eleven others were condemned to death and executed. Nineteen were imprisoned and fourteen were acquitted.

            No doubt she means "lunch" time.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_16"></a>
            This routine was part of the senseless labor in Bergen-Belsen and other camps, designed to weaken and inflict pain on the prisoners and minimize any chance of revolt.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_17"></a>
            Despite Polia's mention of a dentist and a doctor, there was no real medical care for Bergen-Belsen detainees at the time.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_18"></a>
            During the final months of the war, the Allies, with complete air supremacy, bombed Germany relentlessly—often with dire consequences for both German combatants and non-combatants and prisoners.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_19"></a>
            Dachau was established on March 10, 1933. It was the first concentration camp organized by the SS and the model and training ground for all other SS-operated camps. At least 32,000 human beings perished at Dachau during the twelve years of its existence, including inmates subjected to barbarous pseudo-medical experiments conducted there.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_20"></a>
            Jews were among the inmates who were attempting to assume control of the camp after most of the SS guards had fled, leaving a garrison of about two hundred to defend the camp.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_21"></a>
            American soldiers did in fact kill the SS troops manning the guard towers. Several others were killed by Americans who were incensed and sickened by the gruesome sights they encountered upon entering the camp. Some inmates also took retribution against their SS tormentors. However, as Polia indicates, the vast majority of the remaining SS guards were imprisoned.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_22"></a>
            Following the war, survivors and various tracing services posted their names on lists to facilitate searching for relatives. It was no doubt by perusing these lists that Polia's relatives discovered that she was alive. Between the time of her liberation from Dachau and the time she arrived in Paris at the beginning of 1946, there is no indication as to where Polia was recuperating.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_23"></a>
            These were most probably cards with various images designed to evoke emotional and psychological responses from subjects. Polia's responses indicate that she was projecting her own feelings and experiences onto the images.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_24"></a>
            The supremely tragic losses endured by Polia and other survivors included loss of family, loss of home, loss of friends and acquaintances, loss of culture, loss of possessions, loss of dignity, and often loss of faith.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_25"></a>
            For many survivors the ultimate fate of their families remained unknown. Polia was among the lucky and plucky few Polish Jews who survived for five years under German occupation. Some three million other Polish Jews were liquidated.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_26"></a>
            "Soutien gorge" is a French expression for "brassiere." Polia was being trained in brassiere making in the ORT school.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_27"></a>
            Though stateless, Polia was more fortunate than many DPs at the time who were languishing in refugee camps in Germany, Austria and Italy. Most wished to emigrate to Palestine but were denied entry by the British.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.

            There were a number of German female SS guards at Belsen who oversaw and tortured the thousands of Jewish female inmates there. Their behavior might have been made worse in part by their desire to impress their male counterparts.

            In early December, 1944, Josef Kramer became camp commandant, a post formerly held by Adolf Haas. Under Kramer, Bergen-Belsen became a concentration camp. The internal management of the camp was placed in the hands of prisoner overseers as was done in other concentration camps. In order to retain their posts or from sheer sadism, a number felt compelled to demonstrate their ruthlessness. Polia's description of the brutal Jewish female functionaries as "Turkish or Romanian" is highly dubious, especially since Turkey was neutral during World War II. It should be noted that after the war Kramer and other SS administrators of the camp, including sixteen women, were tried for their crimes at Belsen. Kramer and eleven others were condemned to death and executed. Nineteen were imprisoned and fourteen were acquitted.

            Dachau was established on March 10, 1933. It was the first concentration camp organized by the SS and the model and training ground for all other SS-operated camps. At least 32,000 human beings perished at Dachau during the twelve years of its existence, including inmates subjected to barbarous pseudo-medical experiments conducted there.

            American soldiers did in fact kill the SS troops manning the guard towers. Several others were killed by Americans who were incensed and sickened by the gruesome sights they encountered upon entering the camp. Some inmates also took retribution against their SS tormentors. However, as Polia indicates, the vast majority of the remaining SS guards were imprisoned.

            Following the war, survivors and various tracing services posted their names on lists to facilitate searching for relatives. It was no doubt by perusing these lists that Polia's relatives discovered that she was alive. Between the time of her liberation from Dachau and the time she arrived in Paris at the beginning of 1946, there is no indication as to where Polia was recuperating.
