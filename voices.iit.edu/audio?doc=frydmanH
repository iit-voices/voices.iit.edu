    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "23.407","u": "August 7, 1946, Paris. On Rue de Patin, a home for adult displaced people. Interviewee is Miss Henja Frydman, 23 years old, tattoo number 46603 and a triangle. She has some kind of administrative position, as secretary in some office, in part an elective post. She was elected by the deportees themselves. She will tell us her story in German. [She subsequently changes to Yiddish.]"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "67.087","u": "[In German] Miss Frydman, tell us again your full name. How old are you, and where are you from, and so on?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "73.780","u": "My name is Frydman, Henja. I was born...in &#39;24. My parents are Russian. I was arrested..."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "87.561","u": "[interrupting] Miss Frydman, what was the occupation of your parents? How many were there in your family?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "98.537","u": "We were a family of five people. Two brothers, I, and my parents."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "107.241","u": "Oh: Were you...were your brother older or younger?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "111.131","u": "The brothers were older."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "113.797","u": "So. And you were the youngest one?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "115.906","u": "I was the youngest one?"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "117.684","u": "Yes. And what was the occupation of your parents?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "121.450","u": "My father was a merchant."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "124.043","u": "What was he selling?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "126.387","u": "Bonneterie."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "128.512","u": "What?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "129.200","u": "That is in German--underwear."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "133.337","u": "Yes, underwear."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "134.587","u": "Underwear."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "135.181","u": "Did he have a store?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "136.059","u": "No, not a store. By way of his hands."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "139.575","u": "Yes. From hand to hand. Now let us go on. You were in Pinsk."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "146.456","u": "I was born in Pinsk."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "145.029","u": "But where were you when the Germans came to Poland?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "150.784","u": "Oh, no. I am already in France for fifteen years."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "154.472","u": "Oh?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "155.268","u": "I came here as a child."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "156.939","u": "Then your parents had moved from Pinsk to France."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "161.486","u": "From Pinsk they came...from Russia they came to Pinsk, from Pinsk to Poland; that was during the Russian revolution, in Russia."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "168.405","u": "Yes, and then,--"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "169.983","u": "And then they moved to France."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "172.405","u": "Oh. How old were you when you came to France?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "175.847","u": "Seven years."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "176.300","u": "You were a seven-year-old child."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "178.079","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "178.454","u": "And here your father also worked selling underwear?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "182.277","u": "Yes. Underwear and various other small things. Just like all other Jews started to make a living."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "190.678","u": "Oh, then the Germans came while you were in France."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "194.350","u": "In France."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "194.819","u": "Oh, Now, go on. Tell us."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "196.189","u": "They have come in the year, --&#39;40. They occupied Paris."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "198.784","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "199.096","u": "And so about a year or six months passed, and my brother was arrested. He was then 26 years old."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "212.478","u": "Why was he arrested?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "213.837","u": "He was riding to work on a bicycle, and on the way he sees a big raid. The French had erected a barricade, and people were being arrested. He was riding to work, and he noticed that it was not exactly safe. So he turned back to the house to tell my father and my younger brother that they should not leave the house."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "241.407","u": "Where was your older brother? Oh yes, that was your older brother."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "246.088","u": "That was the older brother. "},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "248.682","u": "Well, so what happened then?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "255.667","u": "While he was riding homeward, he was stopped. They requested his papers, and he was what they call in France a engag&#195; volontaire, that is, he had enlisted in the army voluntarily when the war started. But that did not count. he was taken away to Drancy."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "284.205","u": "Well, he was a volunteer in the war against the Germans."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "288.620","u": "Against the Germans."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "289.511","u": "And then he was arrested by the French when the Germans were here?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "293.574","u": "When the Germans were here, "},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "295.382","u": " yes. So that didn&#39;t count that he was--nothing counted. "},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "299.428","u": " They saw his name was Frydman, they saw that he was Jewish, and they did not look any further at his paper."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "308.132","u": "At that time, it was already compulsory to wear the star of David?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "312.420","u": "No, at that time the star of David was not yet worn."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "315.639","u": "So they sent him where to?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "318.295","u": "They sent him away to the first lager in Paris. Drancy."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "322.358","u": "Drancy, Yes."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "324.499","u": "and [here a few words are incomprehensible; she apparently weeps.]"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "329.952","u": "And from there did you hear from him?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "331.827","u": "At the beginning we had no news from there. What was going on at home one can imagine. The mother [a long pause], she didn&#39;t know what to do. I went into the streets [one word not clear] to investigate what exactly was happening. I saw that they were taking all the men, the Jewish ones in the oldest district of Paris. That really was the second time [the second raid] because already a year ago they were taking people from Pithiviers. And then the life started in our home like in so many Jewish homes--one was already missing. In time we got word about happenings in Drancy. People yelled because they have no food. They have nothing to sleep on. It is dirty, and many people die from diarrhea and dysentery. The discipline in the lager was very strict. I shall not describe it."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "412.859","u": "Why not? Tell us; we want to know all about it. Do not skip. These things you have heard from other people?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "423.528","u": "No. I did not hear it from other people. Because in a short time, in spite of the orders of the Germans and of the French, I managed to get into Drancy."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "433.260","u": "Then let&#39;s wait with it a bit. First tell me again. Your brother was in Drancy, and then?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "438.776","u": "For three months we had no word from him."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "442.780","u": "Could you send him food?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "444.806","u": "No. For the first three months it was prohibited to send food. There was just nothing we could do to help our own in the lager. We had to suffer through these months just as it was."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "464.049","u": "Well, what happened then?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "466.768","u": "After three months they started writing. One post-card with a few words in which he said, I am in Drancy, I am well, and nothing more. They didn&#39;t have to write because we heard already what was going on in that lager from the inhabitants of Drancy [meaning in this case apparently the suburb of Drancy itself]. They themselves tried to help the people, because they could not stand the screams, &#34;I am hungry, I am hungry.&#34; That they heard all day. For the first time in many years people experienced real starvation. They began to understand what German rule means, what it means to have the Germans in France, for the Jews. [A long pause] It is hard for me to describe these misfortunes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "528.739","u": "Why?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "529.661","u": "Because after this misfortune there came other catastropnes. And worse than the other."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "536.913","u": "Well, you understand how important it is that these events be described. It is hard for you to talk. It is hard for me to listen but it has to be done. You understand. Go on as well as you can."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "558.593","u": "In three months a lot of people already started to die. The Germans gave an order that they pick out the young ones up to the age of twenty-five who were in a bad state."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "579.575","u": "What does that mean?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "579.575","u": "In a bad condition."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "582.599","u": "Yes. Only those up to the age of twenty-five who are in a bad condition."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "587.438","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "587.985","u": "We started then to hope that our brother would get out. He was twenty-six years old. I went again to Drancy and saw the people who were released."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "603.493","u": "Had you been to Drancy once before?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "607.416","u": "I was here already before. But I couldn&#39;t see him, because they were not permitted to show their faces. And we couldn&#39;t see them. "},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "618.587","u": "Could you please describe the place of Drancy where they were kept?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "625.537","u": "I can describe this place very well, because--"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "627.989","u": "Oh, yes. Let us do it later. Because you were there."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "630.923","u": "I lived there for a year before Drancy became a lager."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "636.206","u": "Oh."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "636.753","u": "I lived there when they started building."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "641.795","u": "When they started building?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "643.217","u": "Yes. Since in America there are tall buildings, they started here to build such a building, which was intended for the gendarmerie."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "657.988","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "658.692","u": "And as a child I was going to play there, and a few years afterwards I was going to see my brother there. The buildings were ready, though the people who lived in these buildings didn&#39;t know for what purpose and for whom they would be used."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "685.990","u": "Then the building was built a long time before?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "689.243","u": "A long time before. A number of years."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "692.315","u": "Yes. It was not built by prisoners."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "696.412","u": "No, no. They looked very nice, like buildings for large families, or for soldiers or for police who had an armory."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "709.489","u": "So when you came to Drancy--"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "714.285","u": "When I came to Drancy, I was very much--it is hard for me to tell it in Yiddish--surprised."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "721.556","u": "You were very much surprised. [Footnote: She stated at the beginning that she would speak German. Her German was rather ungrammatical but fluent. During the interview she does not call her dialect German but Yiddish. Here we have the peculiar language pattern so frequently found among the DPs. First Yiddish-Russian, then French, then German, then French again. The consequences for mental health and personality adjustment of such forced changes of linguistic behavior, most frequently under duress, with but little or no scholastic aid, have hardly been explored.]"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "723.827","u": "I was very much surprised. Here the houses are ready, and instead of people living in them they were occupied by Jewish prisoners."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "733.164","u": "Now then, after three months, why was not your brother released?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "741.026","u": "He was not released because he looked too well, and because he was one year older. The number of the released was very small. I was waiting all day, and before my eyes there came out corpses, just corpses. I was sixteen years old, and for the first time before my eyes marched dead people. I have never before in my life seen a corpse."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "774.740","u": "Men and women?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "776.114","u": "Just men, only men. They were only men."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "779.078","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "779.844","u": "They were unable to walk, their eyes looked wild, they were unable to talk. The same picture we have seen from the lager Auschwitz or other various lagers. None humans. It was grotesque. Two legs, two hands they had, but no face of a normal person. The families came and those who were able to recognize their own--because not always could they be recognized--only a few recognized them, and they took them home and their joy was great. And the mourning of those whose own remained in the lager was also very great."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "836.326","u": "What happened to them?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "837.145","u": "A large number died at home, because if a mother got back her child, he was given his ration, and he being very hungry threw himself at the food, and they would get sick, and they would not adjust to the change."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "865.073","u": "The change? [Interviewer translates thus what is really a neologism which she made up for the word change.]"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "867.344","u": "The change of the food--of the food and also of life. And so the time passed, and the people who remained in Drancy remained there. Conditions improved there a little bit. We were allowed to send packages to the lager, and it is superfluous to say that everyone, the families who didn&#39;t have enough for themselves, sent whatever they could to their own in the lager. People started to get letters. Not in the legal way. In an illegal way. And my brother wrote that we should not worry about him. Nothing would happen."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "918.199","u": "What do you mean, &#39;nothing would happen&#39;?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "920.246","u": "Nothing would happen, he would come through, that the Germans would go away. He wanted to give hope to the family. But he was intelligent enough not to expect anything. People talked already about deportations. To be shipped away, one did not know where. And it was. All at once we got a letter. [A long pause--here apparently she weeps. Her silent weeping now goes over into sobs.] And my brother was being deported. [A long pause. Again Miss Frydman continues in tears.] The mourning at home was great."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "961.717","u": "They knew in advance that they were being deported?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "966.729","u": "It was known that they were being deported."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "968.536","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "969.099","u": "It was told that they are going to lagers to work. But our instinct told us that it is not for work, because we already had seen what they made of people still infants near to Paris, that humans were made into no-humans. Deported. And there was no more word from him."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "996.339","u": "Where was he deported? Do you know?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "998.369","u": "We didn&#39;t know where he was deported."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1000.291","u": "Was it found out later?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "1002.833","u": "Afterwards, when I was deported to Auschwitz, I asked and around everywhere among the men. Possibly somebody knew, but nobody had seen him. [Her speech here is still interrupted by repeated blowing of her nose.] Why he wasn&#39;t seen I know; because my brother had died of typhus, right at the beginning."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1027.346","u": " Who informed you about that?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "1029.906","u": "One of our acquaintances who has now returned. He had seen him in the lager Auschwitz in 1942, that my brother fell, that he got sick with typhus, and died immediately afterwards. In 1942 it was impossible to overcome an illness in Auschwitz because there was no hospital; there was no nothing. There were only Germans, just to kill the people, not to let them live. Only by miracle some people survived, from the year 1942, because in 1942 Auschwitz was not a work lager, but Auschwitz was--and it was written so on a sign--an extermination lager."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1087.433","u": "Where was it written?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "1088.951","u": "[Somewhat resentful] It was written--and one could understand the meaning of Dante. [Interviewer appeared somewhat surprised, because she gave the French pronunciation of the name, which at the moment he failed to understand, and by way of explanation she gave the name in Italian.]"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1101.674","u": "Oh, yes."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "1102.267","u": "&#39;He who enters here does not come out anymore.&#39; And so it was. People entered but did not come out. Oh, yes, they came out through the chimneys. There are various ways to get out, and through these ways [the chimneys] the Jews came out."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1123.755","u": "The chimneys--that were--"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "1125.755","u": "The crematories."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1127.005","u": "The chimneys."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "1129.050","u": "Yes, the chimneys."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1130.284","u": "And you were still at home?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "1134.550","u": "And we still were at home. The time passed. Life is strong. We remained with hope, with little hope. And we lived on. I studied."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1151.761","u": "Where did you study?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "1152.948","u": "In the &#34;faculty&#34; of Paris."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1154.698","u": "What did you study, Henja?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "1161.517","u": "For teacher. To become [a teacher] of foreign languages."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1164.650","u": "What language did you study?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "1166.572","u": "English, English! I can&#39;t speak [it] anymore, because I have forgotten it in the lager, almost everything I have learned. It comes back in trickles. But with great difficulty. My father worked, my younger brother also worked."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1183.301","u": "What did your father work in?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "1185.285","u": "There wasn&#39;t much to do, but he peddled, the same as before, from hand to hand. We had enough to live on, to live very simply. But in those times that was already unimportant. What was important was to manage to survive the Germans, and to be--to take care that the family should not be struck again."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1218.818","u": "And so?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "1219.302","u": "And so the time passed, and one day we got word that the Germans were preparing a torch raid on the Jews, especially against young girls and young boys.

Informed that only the young would be taken, my parents said that I should hide with a French girl friend with whom I went to school.

Right the next morning when I heard the news that in all Paris they had taken the Jews, I immediately took a bus and went home to ask the neighbors, the people who lived around, what has happened to my parents. Nobody was able to tell. From house to house, from acquaintance to acquaintance. I found out that the police had come at night, and they said that they were going up to the second floor to another Jewish tenant, and so my father and mother and brother got out of the house and disappeared in the night. They got away and came to acquaintances who were French, Jewish-French; and there they hid because in those times they did not take yet French Jews. I found out about it, and I came to them. And the scene at the moment shall also not be described. One can&#39;t imagine it.

They could not move around freely, and at first could not do the same things as the others, because to supply them with false identification papers was not a matter of one day. So it was a section of the Resistance. It wasn&#39;t the business of one day to manage the papers. So we had to find a place to live till the false papers were arranged, and that was not easy. In a few months, in three months, we started working with the French cells. Just like the French. A number of us became French Partisans. Partisans you have heard about. Many of us worked in propaganda. Others of us worked in solidarity units, that is, to help the mothers who had remained with children. And many of us were arrested in a short time but that could not scare us; we went on with our work.

No way of expressing it, that can describe what happened from the day when we disembarked from the train in the lager Auschwitz until the day of our liberation. The liberation of a few hundred deportees from Auschwitz. I was almost two years in the lager. I was fortunate enough not to be evacuated like the others on the roads, where so many have died, after two years of life in the lager. We were lined up five abreast, men on the one side, women on the other side. German officers, with a stick in hand, with savage outcries which were for us still new, started dividing us up, one to the right, one to the left, whichever way it would occur to them. &#39;Leave your bundles here; you will return presently. We will just count you up.&#39; We left our packages, women were separated from men, sisters from brothers, women to one side, and the men away to the other side. They then started what was called a selection. They asked us who were tired, and they told these to step into the trucks which were waiting. They also told us that the old people shouldn&#39;t exert themselves by walking on foot, and that they should mount the trucks and they would be driven to the lager, and the young ones should walk. [The next sentence is not clear.] Out of a transport of fifteen hundred people, men, women, and children--a large number were children--we came into the lager two hundred and fifty French girls and women, and the rest climbed into the trucks, the rest of the women and the older men, also the sick, and they told us the trucks go to a second lager. The men were handled the same way as we were when we started our march to the lager. Now we enter. German soldiers lead us. We assemble on a large square--empty, not a tree grows, not a living human being outside--only Germans. And yelling, &#39;Fast!&#39; and &#39;Move on!&#39; The words that we already knew well. We looked at each other--to speak was prohibited--and we see that we are already trapped good. When one enters the lager at the gates, there are flowers, beautiful flowers indeed. And the windows are adorned with very beautiful curtains, and you know what these curtains were--Thalsisin [prayer shawls]--Jewish prayer shawls for curtains. I stared at it--my father used to pray every day--and I was thinking, &#39;How is it that we see a Thaleis, a Jewish Thaleis on these windows--hung up there?&#39; And that meant a lot. The hanging of the prayer shawls meant a lot. We were moved into a barracks, we were locked up for all night with no food, no drink. We didn&#39;t have anymore our things. They called in girls from the lager, Slovakian girls, Jewish, and they started first of all to take off our &#34;fingers&#34; the golden things that one had, watches, engagement rings--all that was taken off.

Why wasn&#39;t it very strict? Because they knew that in Oświęcim they would be taken away. And immediately they started to tattoo us. That means to write the number on our hands. Many fainted. I personally revived three of my acquaintances. With a pen they wrote the numbers on our hands with a special ink--the number which I still have today, first, because it won&#39;t come off, and second, because I don&#39;t want to remove it. The number was written on, and hungry, in dirt and in the cold--in spite of the fact that it was in the month of June, it is very cold in upper Silesia--we lay down to sleep on the ground. One German woman was with us in the barracks, and she said that we would have to manage this night, and tomorrow we would go into our barracks. That night, the first night, we couldn&#39;t sleep, couldn&#39;t believe it was we who lived that way. Lying on the floor, we were frightfully tired.

We finally lived to see the dawn, the day of Auschwitz. That is, the day begins at 4:00. A husky German women from those--with a black triangle, which we learned afterwards meant a German prostitute, started pushing us around, and led us to what was called a shower bath. That is, where people went to bathe. On the way to the &#34;zaune&#34; [shower-bath] we had to stand in the lager, on the lager street they called it, and it was the hour when the men assembled to go to work. And we hear music. A march of death--exactly a march of death. We see how men are beaten, and people scream, and men fall, --one cannot call them men. They had no more the appearance of men. Frightfully thin, dressed in rags, faces full of panic, in tatters, marching five abreast, and singing because they were ordered to sing."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "4932.172","u": "What were they singing?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "4933.734","u": "German songs.

From above a man and two or three of them looked at us; our eyes were fixed on the earth, and we could not believe what was happening. First of all, we were taken to the shearing room. Again Slovakian girls--why Slovakians? Because they were the first prisoners in the lager -those were girls about twenty years of age, those who managed to survive the year of torment.

But from one after another we heard the same story. All who climbed into the trucks are in the crematories. An hour later they showed us a fire which rose from the chimneys. Those are the bodies which burned, they gave us to understand. These old prisoners. And that we could see. We saw it burning, burning intensely. We felt the smell of skin, living skin. We are in the &#34;zaune,&#34; in the shearing room. They shear off our hair. As they do it to me, completely. A clipper went over our heads. All the hair from the head. We look at each other.

I laugh because I can&#39;t believe. I laugh because it appears to me that I am not alive, that I am dreaming, that this is a nightmare, that this is not true. And that is only the first day. The hair off--under the shower. A cold, horrible shower. No soap. That coarse German woman, that prostitute, stands and yells, and if one doesn&#39;t wash herself fast enough, a blow with a stick. The shower is over. After the shower to dress. We are given trousers. Man&#39;s trousers and men&#39;s shirts. Worn, dirty. We are also given men&#39;s underclothes.

To describe exactly what was going on in the lager, I can&#39;t. I am telling the truth. I can&#39;t. There I saw around me corpses. Girls with tortured faces. Constantly screaming. I did not believe then that I would ever live among people again. I thought that I had fallen into a different world. Completely different world.

One of the girls who stood in front was injured by the stones that fell from the building, and she sustained a fracture. We were ordered--she was laid down, she screamed horribly because she was badly in pain, and we were told to continue working as before. And that is how we worked at the building, in fright and not to forget, under the blows and under the laughter of the Germans, until five o&#39;clock in the evening. Then we fell into formation, got our shoes; one couldn&#39;t find her own shoes, one would put on whatever could be found. And back we went to the lager.

Bread, black bread, of 200 grams, a little piece of sausage, one little round slice, and from time to time, a little piece of margarine. Finally that we could get into our block and stretch out on our bed. I shall speak of my group. We were five girls, nineteen years old, three mothers of children between thirty-five and forty years."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "6758.345","u": "Were the children with them?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "6760.407","u": "No, the children either remained in France, if they managed to hide them, or the children were brought to the lager and there perished in the gas,[Footnote: The custom to use the word gas to designate the gas chambers, or gas-killings (German--vergasung) is likely to cause the unaccustomed listener some incidents of discomfort. The word gas means in Yiddish and in colloquial German a &#34;street&#34; (Gasse), the &#34;outdoors.&#34; Gehen in gas under ordinary circumstances means: to go out, to take a walk, to look for incidental business to panhandle. It was therefore somewhat difficult to get into the habit of associating the words gehen in gas with their new connotation--to die in the gas chambers. This was especially difficult because the interviewees pronounced the expression with so much fluency and matter-of-factness that it really sounded like they would say &#34;he just stepped out&#34;, or &#34;they are out for a walk&#34;.] because children were separated from the mother, and they were sent into the gas. [A long pause.] We spoke very little. We were very tired, and we were talking about how it was possible for such things to happen. One is beaten, one starved, people being gassed. We remembered a song that we sang in Drancy, that was a song that came from Dachau, which was composed by the first prisoners of Dachau, and this song was very well suited to the lager. "},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "6828.277","u": "How did that song come over to Drancy?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "6832.464","u": "To Drancy?

That was translated from the German. Then the song says: &#39;Far away in some place there are large spaces of bad soil, where the bullets do not sing in the dried up trees. You only hear the steps of the Germans and the rattle of the arms, and only crying and weeping, and no song comes from the lager.&#39; That song indeed described the lager. The tune itself was a good description. It is a very sad tune. We sang that song, and so passed the day."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "6958.358","u": "What melody was it?

Not only death to the one who tries to escape, run away, but death to all those who are there. Now I shall start the chapter, the general chapter about the lager. By that I mean, about the psychology of the Germans. Why and how they have led people to the state in which we found ourselves. First of all, they made Jews, old prisoners, responsible for the management of a block. They made the Jewish physicians, the doctors, responsible for selecting the sick from the hospital--because afterward there was a hospital--and sending them into the gas. They made Jews responsible for management of the work. They [the Germans] only had to receive their reports and to see to it that their orders were complied with. And that is why we saw Jews beating Jews, and that is why we hear now that bandits have come out of the lager. That is, the Germans have made bandits out of the Jews. They led them into a situation in which they had no time to think. There was no such thing among us as thinking. We did not think. I don&#39;t say. I personally was fortunate not to have any responsibilities. I was just a common prisoner. I was not hated like the prisoners who had responsible positions. A Jew would beat a Jew, because Germans were strict, and the German would beat the Jew who did not want to beat another Jew. Jews worked in the crematories, which means that Jews have been burning their own kindred, because the first day when they came to the lager they would be assigned to such positions, and the Germans looked on, and ordered them to start fires and to burn."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "7223.562","u": "Of course, they burned only the bodies."},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "7226.234","u": "They burned the bodies, yes. They burned the bodies because, before the people went through the gas chambers, they told the people that they were going bathing, that they were going to take a shower. And these gas chambers, according to a report from a friend I have who worked there, looked exactly like a shower bath. Little holes for the water to come through, but instead of water would come through gas. And in this way the people were destroyed. And from there to the crematories, like into a bakery. The system went like this. There was room in the furnace for three people, a stout one, a thin one, and a very thin one. And those three people were shoved in, and they burned. And so the crematories were arranged. They were in Birkenau, six crematories, which have been working day and night with interruption. [Pause]. I shall not continue in order. I shall speak about the things that pass now through my thoughts. I was in Krankenburg. That is, the hospital--one may call it a &#34;hospital&#34;. I was sick with typhus, spotted typhus, and pneumonia in addition. I was for three months in a hospital. You may ask why I was three months in a hospital. Well, they did nothing to heal us. I survived the three months of the hospital just due to my character. I was not far from death. I did not look like a human being anymore. Only my thoughts were still human. I was thinking about getting away. My fever was 40-41 degress C. It wasn&#39;t possible to stand it. All at once the Germans came in and ordered that the whole hospital be sent into the gas, all the sick. They said that otherwise we might infect the whole lager; and we were registered, and we were expecting that trucks will come to take us to the gas. I thought that I would not let them take me into the gas. I had in the lager a girl friend whose name was Molly Zinnenbaum [??], from Belgium. She was a messenger."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "7439.755","u": "A what?"},    {"who": "Henja Frydman", "start": "7440.723","u": "A messenger. That is, she had a good job in the lager, which consisted of making lists of the people in the hospital who should go to work in the lager. She was in contact with the woman lager manager, the German, and she did a lot for us, and she saved me from the gas. She said that I was her cousin, and that if I am being sent to the gas, she should be, also. And since the Germans needed her in their work, I was excluded from the list, and I was out of that. There followed two or three more of such moments, and the same Molly saved me. The same Molly was shot in Birkenau in the lager where I was because she escaped from the lager. She escaped in &#39;43 or at the end of &#39;44 [??]. She was the first Jewish girl who made an attempt to escape. For fifteen days she was at liberty. Then unfortunately she was caught. She was brought back to the lager, and on the square--it was ordered that all Jewish girls should assemble on the square--and that Molly would be shot. We all assembled. Molly was standing before our eyes, pale. And the woman lager leader made a speech. She said..."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "7556.165","u": "This concludes Spool 32.

That really was the second time [the second raid] because already a year ago they were taking people from Pithiviers. And then the life started in our home like in so many Jewish homes--one was already missing. In time we got word about happenings in Drancy. People yelled because they have no food. They have nothing to sleep on. It is dirty, and many people die from diarrhea and dysentery. The discipline in the lager was very strict. I shall not describe it.</p>

From eighteen to twenty--twenty-three--twenty-five years of age. We found it out from a French policeman. We should not remain at home. Informed that only the young would be taken, my parents said that I should hide with a French girl friend with whom I went to school. And so I did, and my brother was also to go away to one of his friends. And so--that was--I really can&#39;t tell you exactly when.</p>

And I did not believe that they would take only the young. My suspicions were correct. At night they came to our home, as to all Jewish homes, to take my father and my mother. Right the next morning when I heard the news that in all Paris they had taken the Jews, I immediately took a bus and went home to ask the neighbors, the people who lived around, what has happened to my parents. Nobody was able to tell. From house to house, from acquaintance to acquaintance. I found out that the police had come at night, and they said that they were going up to the second floor to another Jewish tenant, and so my father and mother and brother got out of the house and disappeared in the night. They got away and came to acquaintances who were French, Jewish-French; and there they hid because in those times they did not take yet French Jews. I found out about it, and I came to them. And the scene at the moment shall also not be described. One can&#39;t imagine it. A child that has thought that her parents were already in the hands of the Germans, and she sees that they are not yet fallen into their hands. Three months my parents were hiding with those Jews and lived in terror. They could not leave the house. Neither could they work.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">The Resistance was formed through small groups of young people, who belonged to various clubs. Sport clubs managed to get together. At school they also had talks among themselves. In my group we made a Jewish section, because Jews had other methods of action. They could not move around freely, and at first could not do the same things as the others, because to supply them with false identification papers was not a matter of one day. So it was a section of the Resistance. It wasn&#39;t the business of one day to manage the papers. So we had to find a place to live till the false papers were arranged, and that was not easy. In a few months, in three months, we started working with the French cells. Just like the French. A number of us became French Partisans. Partisans you have heard about. Many of us worked in propaganda. Others of us worked in solidarity units, that is, to help the mothers who had remained with children. And many of us were arrested in a short time but that could not scare us; we went on with our work. It is understood that in spite of the fact that we were in the Resistance, we had different viewpoints. The groups originated not only in sport groups, but also there were various political groups. I belonged to the Communist youth.</p>

My parents were already old, about fifty-six, and of course they could not share my views. They feared for their daughter and they thought that if she would live with them she would be at home and could be protected by a [work] certificate. She would be able to leave the terrible conditions, so to speak, in which we all found ourselves. I couldn&#39;t say that my father worked for the Germans. No. He did not work for them. Through his connections he got a certificate. My brother was working, like many young people, in a factory which previously was a factory of fur jackets. But the difference was that [now] the fur jackets were going to Germany, whether we cared to know or not. That was the situation. I did not return home and so I got torn away from my parents.

I knew that one word about my parents, and they would be taken also. Where from do I have the papers? A whole story came to my imagination, and I spun a yarn, a very foolish yarn. One did not need, for them, a very smart yarn. I asked the inspectors permission--excuse me, but I have to recollect the events. But I want to show you how far the French inspectors were already educated--one really can&#39;t say even educated, because they had not time to get educated. They were already corrupt. I asked his permission to go to the toilet. So one of the inspectors led me all the way to the toilet, and he did not close the door. He followed me every step and spoke ugly words. For the first time in my life my feminine dignity was attacked. I could not imagine that there are in the world such men. They took me to the station. I took with me the things I could carry--my winter clothes, because I understood that I was to be deported, too. From the station I was taken to the bureau, and there were hundreds of inspectors.

For two days, day and night, they were beating my comrades who were arrested before me. I was among the last. They were already tired. They had nothing to find out, because they knew. And so they left me alone. I slept alone in a room in the secret division, as they called it, with six policemen in the room, on the table with no blanket, no nothing, no food, although I had no desire to eat. Through an inspector, who was--I felt that he was not an enemy, I sent a letter to my parents. There again my instinct was sound. He came to my parents and gave them the letter. And in the letter I wrote to my parents that [I said] I hadn&#39;t seen them for two years in case the police came to question them, they should find out that we hadn&#39;t seen each other for a long time.

What he does wrong there is a whole world to yell about it, and to describe it. They didn&#39;t talk about the sixty girls, sixty Jewish girls arrested here in prison. They didn&#39;t tell about the women who were beaten naked, and who were starved. They didn&#39;t talk about them. Women, mothers of children, worked in the Resistance. Women from the Communist party, indeed in large numbers, Communist or not, they worked against the Germans. And that is what counts. The faces were unrecognizable, from the beatings of the Germans. The sick around us, they were all locked up. We spent three weeks in the depot. I received one package from my family, a package made by my mother. I wept bitterly. Feeling the sufferings of my parents. I thought that I had fulfilled my task as a youth, and as a Jewish daughter. From the depot we were sent away--the whole Jewish group. They didn&#39;t make a political issue of us. They did not make of our case a question of the Resistance. They made of our case a Jewish question. And for Jews there was one place, Drancy, and from Drancy--deportation. I came to the same lager where my brother was. I even met some men who had lived together with my brother.</p>

One cannot really be sure whether she is informed of the facts or not. Or is it, as in so many cases of DPs, that she really does not want to talk about the Germans and whatever happened to them? Only in the second part, when she begins, &#39;and there was a reason for&#39; she becomes animated and persuasive.] [After a pause] He came, and they prepared lists. Each one was questioned. They did not say for what purpose. They were very insistent in asking whether we still had families in France, and where these families were, but we were not so foolish as to tell about our families.

                    <p class="utterance">Now begins the long chapter of two years imprisonment in Auschwitz. It will not be easy for me, indeed, as all of us say when we are asked to tell. To tell! That is the hardest thing for us. Why? Because there are no words. No way of expressing it, that can describe what happened from the day when we disembarked from the train in the lager Auschwitz until the day of our liberation. The liberation of a few hundred deportees from Auschwitz. I was almost two years in the lager. I was fortunate enough not to be evacuated like the others on the roads, where so many have died, after two years of life in the lager. We were lined up five abreast, men on the one side, women on the other side. German officers, with a stick in hand, with savage outcries which were for us still new, started dividing us up, one to the right, one to the left, whichever way it would occur to them. &#39;Leave your bundles here; you will return presently. We will just count you up.&#39; We left our packages, women were separated from men, sisters from brothers, women to one side, and the men away to the other side. They then started what was called a selection. They asked us who were tired, and they told these to step into the trucks which were waiting. They also told us that the old people shouldn&#39;t exert themselves by walking on foot, and that they should mount the trucks and they would be driven to the lager, and the young ones should walk. [The next sentence is not clear.] Out of a transport of fifteen hundred people, men, women, and children--a large number were children--we came into the lager two hundred and fifty French girls and women, and the rest climbed into the trucks, the rest of the women and the older men, also the sick, and they told us the trucks go to a second lager. The men were handled the same way as we were when we started our march to the lager. Now we enter. German soldiers lead us. We assemble on a large square--empty, not a tree grows, not a living human being outside--only Germans. And yelling, &#39;Fast!&#39; and &#39;Move on!&#39; The words that we already knew well. We looked at each other--to speak was prohibited--and we see that we are already trapped good. When one enters the lager at the gates, there are flowers, beautiful flowers indeed. And the windows are adorned with very beautiful curtains, and you know what these curtains were--Thalsisin [prayer shawls]--Jewish prayer shawls for curtains. I stared at it--my father used to pray every day--and I was thinking, &#39;How is it that we see a Thaleis, a Jewish Thaleis on these windows--hung up there?&#39; And that meant a lot. The hanging of the prayer shawls meant a lot. We were moved into a barracks, we were locked up for all night with no food, no drink. We didn&#39;t have anymore our things. They called in girls from the lager, Slovakian girls, Jewish, and they started first of all to take off our &#34;fingers&#34; the golden things that one had, watches, engagement rings--all that was taken off. </p>

                    <p class="utterance">It was not permitted in Drancy, but many women and people had hidden these things, and there was no very strict control. Why wasn&#39;t it very strict? Because they knew that in Oświęcim they would be taken away. And immediately they started to tattoo us. That means to write the number on our hands. Many fainted. I personally revived three of my acquaintances. With a pen they wrote the numbers on our hands with a special ink--the number which I still have today, first, because it won&#39;t come off, and second, because I don&#39;t want to remove it. The number was written on, and hungry, in dirt and in the cold--in spite of the fact that it was in the month of June, it is very cold in upper Silesia--we lay down to sleep on the ground. One German woman was with us in the barracks, and she said that we would have to manage this night, and tomorrow we would go into our barracks. That night, the first night, we couldn&#39;t sleep, couldn&#39;t believe it was we who lived that way. Lying on the floor, we were frightfully tired. One of our friends were insane and was yelling, because things made a terrible impression on her. She was in panic.</p>
                                                                                                <b>David Boder</b>

                    <p class="utterance">She was yelling--I don&#39;t remember exactly. All I know is she went insane from the transport. She went insane because she left in France a child. From fright, we were lying one over the other like animals. Stepping one on the other. We finally lived to see the dawn, the day of Auschwitz. That is, the day begins at 4:00. A husky German women from those--with a black triangle, which we learned afterwards meant a German prostitute, started pushing us around, and led us to what was called a shower bath. That is, where people went to bathe. On the way to the &#34;zaune&#34; [shower-bath] we had to stand in the lager, on the lager street they called it, and it was the hour when the men assembled to go to work. And we hear music. A march of death--exactly a march of death. We see how men are beaten, and people scream, and men fall, --one cannot call them men. They had no more the appearance of men. Frightfully thin, dressed in rags, faces full of panic, in tatters, marching five abreast, and singing because they were ordered to sing.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">German songs. German songs, German marches, that the Germans have taught them in the lager. And so we had the first contact with Auschwitz. With clubs and with yells we were told to take off all we had on. Naked men worked in the zaune, prisoners, and in front of the German men and women undressed, naked, and left their things. From above a man and two or three of them looked at us; our eyes were fixed on the earth, and we could not believe what was happening. First of all, we were taken to the shearing room. Again Slovakian girls--why Slovakians? Because they were the first prisoners in the lager -those were girls about twenty years of age, those who managed to survive the year of torment. Then in the year &#39;43. They started talking to us, and we asked them, the first question, where did the truck go on which our parents went off and our other friends.</p>

We thought she was out of her mind. But from one after another we heard the same story. All who climbed into the trucks are in the crematories. An hour later they showed us a fire which rose from the chimneys. Those are the bodies which burned, they gave us to understand. These old prisoners. And that we could see. We saw it burning, burning intensely. We felt the smell of skin, living skin. We are in the &#34;zaune,&#34; in the shearing room. They shear off our hair. As they do it to me, completely. A clipper went over our heads. All the hair from the head. We look at each other. The fright. People are beaten. Hair is being shorn. People scream. The language we don&#39;t understand.</p>

I failed to recognize my best friend, and I began to laugh, to laugh terribly, a hysterical laughter. The Slovakian girl who is shearing my hair looks at me. What am I laughing about? I laugh because I can&#39;t believe. I laugh because it appears to me that I am not alive, that I am dreaming, that this is a nightmare, that this is not true. And that is only the first day. The hair off--under the shower. A cold, horrible shower. No soap. That coarse German woman, that prostitute, stands and yells, and if one doesn&#39;t wash herself fast enough, a blow with a stick. The shower is over. After the shower to dress. We are given trousers. Man&#39;s trousers and men&#39;s shirts. Worn, dirty. We are also given men&#39;s underclothes. There were girls who were menstruating. They did not pay attention to it. Under the cold shower, they were given no things, and so they remained. There is no need to describe how they look. Dressed in rags, and tatters, and these were clothes of Russian prisoners. We even found buttons on these clothes with the hammer and sickle. A kerchief to hide the hair that was absent, and we go to the bureau. The Germans register us. Register our identity, the name, the family name, occupation and nationality, and so on.

But this is already another chapter. This &#39;count Appell&#39; lasted exactly three hours. For three hours we were standing and waiting for them to come and count us up. Hungry we were, cold we were, frightened we were, because we saw where we were. To describe exactly what was going on in the lager, I can&#39;t. I am telling the truth. I can&#39;t. There I saw around me corpses. Girls with tortured faces. Constantly screaming. I did not believe then that I would ever live among people again. I thought that I had fallen into a different world. Completely different world. In my disordered thoughts, I reasoned, maybe, there is more than one world, a world where one lives normally, but that possibly there is also another world, where life is entirely different, and in such a life people also do live. I thought so then because I believed that one could not stand it, that one could not live through Auschwitz. But I had to live through, I must live through to be able to come back and tell to the world what I have seen. I have returned, but to tell it is not so easy. Mornings we were going to work. I will give you now an account of the work. I will tell you what kind of work we did. We got up at four o&#39;clock in the morning. It was dark and cold. At night we couldn&#39;t sleep, because we slept eight or ten people on one bed that was four meters wide and four meters long. I don&#39;t speak about the food, because we were getting a little piece of black bread of about 200 grams [half a pound] for the whole day. Lice, vermin, as they say in French--were crawling over us as if we were prisoners already a long, long, time. By the hundreds; one could not stand it or sleep at night, so badly were we itching from the lice, the bedbugs, the fleas.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">The work in the lager of Auschwitz. In the year 1943 it wasn&#39;t called anymore an extermination camp, but a work camp, and the slogan of the Germans was &#34;work makes free.&#34; Our slogan was &#34;Work makes free in the crematories two and three.&#34; And our slogan was most correct. As I have already said, we got up at four o&#39;clock in the morning. And that day it was raining. Right the first day we were sent to work. For two hours we were standing for the count-Appell. That means until six o&#39;clock. Five abreast and a capo, a German again, a German prostitute. They had very low elements to manage the lager, because normal people, clean people, would not have been capable of such management. A capo led us to the gate, and again there are standing a whole group of German elite. That German, the lager commandant, the work Fuehrer, and all the company leaders, the German soldiers who were leading us to work and who guarded us. Every soldier was leading a dog, to guard us and watch us. Without a word, just &#39;left&#39;...&#39;left&#39;...We marched through the gate, and the Germans looked at the women who had arrived yesterday, beautiful and young, and they laughed at the derelicts into which they had been converted in one day.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">At work, yes. If a guard had a chance to hit somebody, he did so. If he had a chance to set the dog on us, he did so as well. One company leader, that is, a German soldier, got out of formation and marched among us, leading us straight. &#39;Left&#39;...just like soldiers so we shouldn&#39;t forget to step first with the left foot and all together. Many women didn&#39;t know what it means, &#39;left&#39;. They were mother of children, and all at once they had become soldiers and did not know &#39;left&#39;. They paid dearly for it. The punishment was a bad beating. Everyone wanted to march inside the formation, because on the sides one would be exposed to blows. In front one was responsible for the stop. We had to walk very fast. Inside the formation one could escape the blows. The mud was deep and heavy. The terrain was as if made to order for a lager. It was pouring rain, and one could not drag his legs out of the ground. One was unable to walk, especially with those shoes, which were too large. How many kilometers we marched I don&#39;t know. About the beatings we were given, about the girls and women, well, I don&#39;t have to tell you. People fell, stepped one over the other; there was no time to turn around. It was pouring. The chimneys were on fire at the same time. A German was yelling. Some of us were weeping. They couldn&#39;t walk. The shoes were too large, and they fell. What can one do? What should on do? We arrived. I think we walked eight kilometers through a big field. We were ordered to take off our shoes. You know what for? We should not wear out the shoes. We took off our shoes. We were ordered to step into the water. There was a pond, with dirty water. There was a pond, and we had to go into the water up to the head and lift weeds out of the water. What they needed those for I don&#39;t know. It really wasn&#39;t any work. It was ordered simply to torture us.</p>

We were ordered--she was laid down, she screamed horribly because she was badly in pain, and we were told to continue working as before. And that is how we worked at the building, in fright and not to forget, under the blows and under the laughter of the Germans, until five o&#39;clock in the evening.

                    <p class="utterance">No, the children either remained in France, if they managed to hide them, or the children were brought to the lager and there perished in the gas,[Footnote: The custom to use the word gas to designate the gas chambers, or gas-killings (German--vergasung) is likely to cause the unaccustomed listener some incidents of discomfort. The word gas means in Yiddish and in colloquial German a &#34;street&#34; (Gasse), the &#34;outdoors.&#34; Gehen in gas under ordinary circumstances means: to go out, to take a walk, to look for incidental business to panhandle. It was therefore somewhat difficult to get into the habit of associating the words gehen in gas with their new connotation--to die in the gas chambers. This was especially difficult because the interviewees pronounced the expression with so much fluency and matter-of-factness that it really sounded like they would say &#34;he just stepped out&#34;, or &#34;they are out for a walk&#34;.] because children were separated from the mother, and they were sent into the gas. [A long pause.] We spoke very little. We were very tired, and we were talking about how it was possible for such things to happen. One is beaten, one starved, people being gassed. We remembered a song that we sang in Drancy, that was a song that came from Dachau, which was composed by the first prisoners of Dachau, and this song was very well suited to the lager. </p>

                    <p class="utterance">French. That was translated from the German. Then the song says: &#39;Far away in some place there are large spaces of bad soil, where the bullets do not sing in the dried up trees. You only hear the steps of the Germans and the rattle of the arms, and only crying and weeping, and no song comes from the lager.&#39; That song indeed described the lager. The tune itself was a good description. It is a very sad tune. We sang that song, and so passed the day.</p>

Not only death to the one who tries to escape, run away, but death to all those who are there. Now I shall start the chapter, the general chapter about the lager. By that I mean, about the psychology of the Germans. Why and how they have led people to the state in which we found ourselves. First of all, they made Jews, old prisoners, responsible for the management of a block. They made the Jewish physicians, the doctors, responsible for selecting the sick from the hospital--because afterward there was a hospital--and sending them into the gas. They made Jews responsible for management of the work. They [the Germans] only had to receive their reports and to see to it that their orders were complied with. And that is why we saw Jews beating Jews, and that is why we hear now that bandits have come out of the lager. That is, the Germans have made bandits out of the Jews. They led them into a situation in which they had no time to think. There was no such thing among us as thinking. We did not think. I don&#39;t say. I personally was fortunate not to have any responsibilities. I was just a common prisoner. I was not hated like the prisoners who had responsible positions. A Jew would beat a Jew, because Germans were strict, and the German would beat the Jew who did not want to beat another Jew. Jews worked in the crematories, which means that Jews have been burning their own kindred, because the first day when they came to the lager they would be assigned to such positions, and the Germans looked on, and ordered them to start fires and to burn.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">They burned the bodies, yes. They burned the bodies because, before the people went through the gas chambers, they told the people that they were going bathing, that they were going to take a shower. And these gas chambers, according to a report from a friend I have who worked there, looked exactly like a shower bath. Little holes for the water to come through, but instead of water would come through gas. And in this way the people were destroyed. And from there to the crematories, like into a bakery. The system went like this. There was room in the furnace for three people, a stout one, a thin one, and a very thin one. And those three people were shoved in, and they burned. And so the crematories were arranged. They were in Birkenau, six crematories, which have been working day and night with interruption. [Pause]. I shall not continue in order. I shall speak about the things that pass now through my thoughts. I was in Krankenburg. That is, the hospital--one may call it a &#34;hospital&#34;. I was sick with typhus, spotted typhus, and pneumonia in addition. I was for three months in a hospital. You may ask why I was three months in a hospital. Well, they did nothing to heal us. I survived the three months of the hospital just due to my character. I was not far from death. I did not look like a human being anymore. Only my thoughts were still human. I was thinking about getting away. My fever was 40-41 degress C. It wasn&#39;t possible to stand it. All at once the Germans came in and ordered that the whole hospital be sent into the gas, all the sick. They said that otherwise we might infect the whole lager; and we were registered, and we were expecting that trucks will come to take us to the gas. I thought that I would not let them take me into the gas. I had in the lager a girl friend whose name was Molly Zinnenbaum [??], from Belgium. She was a messenger.</p>

She was in contact with the woman lager manager, the German, and she did a lot for us, and she saved me from the gas. She said that I was her cousin, and that if I am being sent to the gas, she should be, also. And since the Germans needed her in their work, I was excluded from the list, and I was out of that. There followed two or three more of such moments, and the same Molly saved me. The same Molly was shot in Birkenau in the lager where I was because she escaped from the lager. She escaped in &#39;43 or at the end of &#39;44 [??]. She was the first Jewish girl who made an attempt to escape. For fifteen days she was at liberty. Then unfortunately she was caught. She was brought back to the lager, and on the square--it was ordered that all Jewish girls should assemble on the square--and that Molly would be shot. We all assembled.
