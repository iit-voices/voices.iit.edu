From this day every German may shoot as many Jews as he wants. That means they were not permitted to enter the Ghetto but if anybody came near to the wire fence, as far as his rifle could reach, he could shoot him. Hundreds and hundreds of people perished in the Ghetto of Lodz in this way. [Pause] The worst thing in the Ghetto was the state of distress. We began to receive very little food. A ration, an allotment for fourteen days consisted in the Ghetto of the following: Three deka of turnips, forty deka of flour, and ten deka of oatflakes, and forty-five deka of sugar. This [the sugar] consisted of twenty deka brown, dark sugar, and twenty-five deka white sugar. This was the ration for fourteen days.</p>

The committee received the allotment for the entire house, and they distributed it to all the people. This was very bad. They stole. But Rumkowski remedied this. It may be considered in favor of Rumkowski that he didn&#39;t permit theft. What does it mean, he didn&#39;t permit theft? Enough was stolen because whoever had a hand and a leg stole. But at least the ration that was allotted to every person, this at least everbody received. It was organized in this way. There was a warehouse. There in this warehouse the allotment of food was received. For example, the street [section] from Podrzeizna to Polska was assigned to the twentieth district-warehouse. There were in the Ghetto forty-three district-warehouses arranged according to streets. And everybody had a card, a card for bread, a card for vegetables, a card for nutrients//meat?/, and so forth. Today, for instance, comes out bread for such and such card numbers. One went to the warehouse, the card was clipped, entered in the book: On this and this day such and such a person has received a bread, and . . .</p>
