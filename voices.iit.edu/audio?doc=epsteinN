There was a great epidemic. Hundreds of people fell a day. After the liberation, two, three, days after the liberation, there had fallen very many people. In about a month half of the lager had fallen. And nothing could be done about it until it...there were full stables, full with dead. People crawled over the dead. It stank terribly. There was raging a severe typhus. And I, too, got sick. I lay four weeks in the hospital. [See the story of Mr. Schlaefrig, vol. VII. chap. 26.]</p>
