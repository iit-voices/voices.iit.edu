We lived in our own house. In 1940, the Germans established, in <a class="placename" href="#vothL155">Zakopane</a>, a health resort, and they ordered all the Jews to leave <a class="placename" href="#vothL155">Zakopane</a>. They allowed us to take some of our things and we had to leave our city. We went to <a class="placename" href="#vothL135">Cracow</a>. Near <a class="placename" href="#vothL135">Cracow</a>, in a small town, we lived for almost a year. Next, we had to go to the <a class="placename" href="#vothC55" type="camp">ghetto</a>, since everyone . . . there was no other place. The Jews were not allowed to live in any other cities besides <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghettos</a>. In the <a class="placename" href="#vothC55" type="camp">ghetto</a>, we lived about a year. During that time, there were several groups who were sent away, which, due to the fact that we were working, we were able to avoid. We were forced to accept shifts of mandatory work. Because those that did not work, got sent elsewhere. And to stay with our child, we accepted work at different companies. My husband in one company, and I at a different company. Next, our posts were eliminated, so we were moved to a camp and we were forced, forced to leave our child at home in the <a class="placename" href="#vothC55" type="camp">ghetto</a>. We had the opportunity to visit our child once a week. Next, the <a class="placename" href="#vothC55" type="camp">ghetto</a> was shut down, when we arrived on the day before the liquidation, we found our home empty, our child was taken away [unintelligible] . . . it was said that there were camps for children, that the children are in the same kind of camps as we were, and that there would be a possibility of seeing them, when the war ends shortly. We cheered each other by saying that we would all be together soon. But our high hopes did not last long, we saw, how they were continuing to treat the children, constantly taking them to the camps away from the <a class="placename" href="#vothC55" type="camp">ghetto</a>. So our continued experiences became sad. In the camp at <a class="placename" href="#vothC89" type="camp">Plaszow</a>, we stayed a year and a half, no, about a year, together with my husband.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="#stumachinL" start="476.233" end="x">[In Polish] I continued to go to my forced job in the city, this was a benefit for us, because, from the city, we could bring home food to eat, and at the camp it was very hard, very difficult, to obtain any nourishment, we would get a pitiful soup, and it was hard to work with that kind of nourishment. So, with what I brought from the city, I could help my husband, as well as other people around us. But this did not last long, the <a class="placename" href="#vothC55" type="camp">ghetto</a> was closed, the camp was closed and Jews were no longer allowed into the city. We were sure that we would stay in that camp and wait until the end of the war, but it played out differently. In 1944 . . . they took <a class="term" href="#vothG_action">action</a> on us, we didn't know, what, in fact, was to happen with the people, who were taken. It turned out that the people who were left, were taken from Poland to work in Germany. Among others, I was taken at this time, but because I didn't want to go, and leave my husband at the camp, I escaped from there. When I arrived back at the camp, I found my husband, who was very happy to see me, that I was able to return from the round-up. The next day, I wanted to visit my husband, turns out, that overnight, he was caught and sent away. From that time, I never saw my husband, to this day. From <a class="placename" href="#vothC89" type="camp">Plaszow</a>, I was taken to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. I stayed in <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a> for three months, in horrible misery. Next, from there, we went on foot until the 18th, 18th of January, during the coldest part of winter we walked to Ravensbricken. I lived in <a class="placename" href="#vothC95" type="camp">Ravensbrück</a>, I was there for 8 weeks. The misery is indescribable, corpses at every step, the experience was hugely overwhelming. We didn't get any food at all. Everyone had to get their own. They came, they brought a cauldron, everyone would throw themselves at the cauldron and whoever got some was able to eat. When we went to . . . tell the Camp <a class="term" href="#vothG_commandant">Commandant</a> they told us [unintelligible] and that's where it ended. After 8 weeks we were taken to Malhoff [<a class="placename" href="#vothC70" type="camp">Malchow</a>?]. There, we were left to starve, that was obvious, that they wanted to starve us to death. In 8 weeks, I lost 15 kilos. I weighed 39 kilos, when I left Malhoff [<a class="placename" href="#vothC70" type="camp">Malchow</a>?]. Besides me, there were others who looked much worse than I did. From Malhoff [<a class="placename" href="#vothC70" type="camp">Malchow</a>?], they took us by train; we traveled for about 3 days, totally without food, until we got to <a class="placename" href="#vothC58" type="camp">Leipzig</a>. We arrived in <a class="placename" href="#vothC58" type="camp">Leipzig</a> during the worst bombings, and we were there for several days. It turned out, that, that it was almost the end of the war and, in truth, we did not work, but we also did not get any food. There was very, very little food, so little; that we thought that, there, we would surely die. After several days, we were taken out into the street and were forced to march like that for 6 weeks. There we walked in circles. Where ever we would get to, on one side were the Russians, on the other the Americans, and the Germans would escape from one front to another. On the way, we gathered greens, so we could eat, this was in April, nothing was growing in the fields yet. We survived on grass and dug up potatoes, which were just planted. On the way, we came across a lot of people who died of hunger, corpses, lying on the road. We were killed if we got the courage to wander away, so we could find something to eat. Regardless of this, none of us were scared and each of us went, because we were faced with death from hunger. We thought that we would never stop, that our road was leading into endlessness. Until one day, a lot of us escaped on the way, but we didn't know . . . we were scared that they would shoot, because that had been our prior experience. Whoever strayed from the group was shot. Regardless of this, many people decided to break away from the march. And one day, I, with two of my girlfriends, broke away, and at one farm, we found work. We worked there for 4 weeks. The Germans were now more or less nice to us, because they were scared, because the front was getting closer and closer. [unintelligible].</span>

I decided that I would rest, but homesickness wouldn't let me rest. In my imagination, I saw my house, and those that I had lost would come back to me. [unintelligible] We had to go on foot. A hundred and fifty kilometers we went on foot, and pulled with us a wagon with food and some tattered rags. We passed cities in ruins, we met people on the way, who were the same as us, on their way home, they sang happy songs of hope and we were also happy. On the 8th of May I arrived in <a class="placename" href="#vothL135">Cracow</a> and there I was met with my first disappointment. Out of my family who lived in <a class="placename" href="#vothL135">Cracow</a>, I couldn't find anyone. For eight days I wondered around <a class="placename" href="#vothL135">Cracow</a>, looking everywhere, where we lived, I searched the homes we had in the <a class="placename" href="#vothC55" type="camp">ghetto</a>, where I left my child. I thought, maybe someone left an address, maybe someone had already been there before me, but it turned out that no one had been there yet. I decided to go to <a class="placename" href="#vothL155">Zakopane</a>, but everyone advised me against it, they said that it was not safe, that Jews should not return to small towns, that there were many incidences. In a word, if I survived the war, then I should wait in a larger city, until our people return, and that they would be able to find us. But I was anxious, I wanted to be there already. I thought that maybe they went there, that maybe they are waiting for me. I decided I was going to go. On the eighth of June, I arrived at my home, and unfortunately I was astonished. There, were my house once stood, was just a field. There was no sign of my house. Some goats were grazing in the pasture. I stayed with my neighbor, and day after day I waited for someone to return. I waited for long days and weeks for nothing. I waited . . . until I was forced by necessity, because I didn't have, because I didn't know, what I should do, I didn't have anything to do . . . I left to find work. For 8 weeks, in a variety of different ways, I earned enough to take care of myself. I didn't want to be taken care of by strangers. Constantly, I would return home with a longing feeling; that maybe someone was waiting there for me, maybe someone would return. Meanwhile, an orphanage was formed in <a class="placename" href="#vothL155">Zakopane</a>, I decided that I would dedicate myself to work with the children, hoping to fill the void in my life. I've been working with the children for a year now, and with them going forth in the world, so that maybe somewhere in our native land I would find peace. They threw us from place to place, maybe finally we will find some place to call our own, where we can live peacefully . . . freely . . . not ridiculed . . . not tormented . . .
                        somewhere where I can look forward to a happier future, children, that will be raised under my care.</span>
