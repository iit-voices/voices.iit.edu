So I say [to myself], 'No, first of all I do not want to stand in the first five. I will go down. I joined another one and with him I began to edge myself toward the back. In the meantime I lost the other on the way. On the stairs which I wanted to take to the second floor...so I looked for a way up. There were lined up prisoners who were old timers who were supposed to remain, who took care of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>.

                Created on May 1, 1940 to intern the 164,000 original Jewish inhabitants of Ł&#195;dź, most of whom were killed at Chelmno or sent to labor camps. During the war, some 43,000 people died there from starvation and disease. When the Russian army occupied Ł&#195;dź in January 1945, only 877 Jews remained.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
