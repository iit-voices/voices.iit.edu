Brod) was in the Tarnopol district of Poland (then southeastern Poland, now northwestern Ukraine). The town was a center of nineteenth century Jewish progressive thinking and had a strong Zionist movement. In September, 1939, the Soviets occupied the city, but the Germans took over shortly after the beginning of their invasion of the Soviet Union on June, 22, 1941. During the German occupation, the Jews of Brody were terrorized, persecuted, ghettoized and then murdered. Only about 250 of the 9,000 Jews in Brody on the eve of World War II survived.</span><sup><a href="#note_1">1</a></sup></note> on the former Austro-Russian border. Later the town belonged to Poland.

On the 17th of September the Red Army received an order to march into West Ukraine and West White Russia in order to liberate the people who were living there as a part of the people of Great Ukraine and of White Russia. After the Soviets were there a month they made a plebiscite, elections. The elections took place in all cities, towns, and villages. Then in <a class="placename" href="#vothL123">Lemberg</a>, during the assembly of all the elected deputies, it was decided to turn to the highest council of Soviet Russia with the request that these countries should be recognized as a part of Soviet Russia. And by this procedure these countries were accepted into the Soviet Union, and they became recognized as part of the country.

The German invasion of the Soviet Union came as a great shock to Stalin, who believed that Hitler would honor the August 1939 non-aggression treaty signed between the two countries. News of German atrocities against Jews in their zone of occupation from 1939-1941 was deliberately withheld from Soviet Jewry who were unprepared for the Nazi onslaught, as was the Red army which was overwhelmed in the early phase of the brutal war. The battle of Stalingrad, lasting from late summer 1942 until the German surrender on February 2, 1943, marked the turning point of the war on the eastern front.</span><sup><a href="#note_7">7</a></sup></note></span>

And this, in fact, is the quintessence, that everyone is drawn to the place where he was born. Because in fact, from my own experience, in Russia the Jews have it, indeed very good. On the whole one cannot complain. The concept of anti-Semitism does not exist there. But every man is drawn to the place where he was born. This is simply such a sentiment. And besides that, this has to be taken into account. Every man...I had many friends from <a class="placename" href="#vothL135">Cracow</a> who returned, because they owned homes there, they had large possessions. And occasionally they also succeed in getting it back, but on the other side, it sometimes leads again to [becoming] victims, for the reason that the Poles, seeing a Jew returning who says,'This was my house. This was my dwelling. These are my possessions'...so they go and kill such a Jew because they do not want to return his possessions which they had grabbed at the time when the Germans were there.<note n="23"><span class="note">In fact, especially by the late 1930's, anti-Semitic attitudes had become widespread among the Soviet elite and were held by many in the general population. Throughout the war, the Jews were not recognized as special victims of Nazi genocide, and this concealment continued after the war. From 1948 to 1953, the Black Years of Soviet Jewry, anti-Semitism became one of the chief policies of the Stalinist regime. </span><sup><a href="#note_23">23</a></sup></note></span>

When we come and find a burned home, a destroyed workshop, seeing that we have lost everything, everything that was dear was killed, we do not want to build any more on these ruins. And because of that the Jew thinks, if to start building, it is better to build in his own homeland, in one's own land. This is one [reason]. And the second -- it is the unceasing danger which threatens. This is the peril to one's life. Because in Poland, as I have said before, exists a strong reactionary force which is committing murder and acts of death on every Jew that they chase in the street or even in his own home. An example of this is the <a class="term" href="#vothG_pogrom">pogrom</a> which took place at this time a year ago in <a class="placename" href="#vothL135">Cracow</a> and a month ago in <a class="placename" href="#vothL84">Kielce</a>,<note n="24"><span class="note">The Polish perpetrators of the Kielce pogrom on July 4, 1946 massacred forty-two Jews in the town of Kielce in southeastern Poland and wounded fifty more.

            Brody (Yid. Brod) was in the Tarnopol district of Poland (then southeastern Poland, now northwestern Ukraine). The town was a center of nineteenth century Jewish progressive thinking and had a strong Zionist movement. In September, 1939, the Soviets occupied the city, but the Germans took over shortly after the beginning of their invasion of the Soviet Union on June, 22, 1941. During the German occupation, the Jews of Brody were terrorized, persecuted, ghettoized and then murdered. Only about 250 of the 9,000 Jews in Brody on the eve of World War II survived.

            Located in southern Poland, the historic city was for several centuries the capital of the early Polish kingdom. Jewish settlement in Kraków dates from at least the early fourteenth century. During the German occupation, the city became the seat of the Nazi General Government run by the notorious Hans Frank.

            Mr. Ferber is referring to the outbreak of World War II which began with the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. Two days later France and Great Britain declared war on Germany.

            In fact, the Soviet Union occupied eastern Poland in accordance with a secret protocol in the Nazi Soviet pact signed on August 23, 1939 between the foreign ministers of the two totalitarian powers. The protocol called for the division of Poland between them by force of arms.

            Treatment of the Jewish population under Soviet rule was certainly better than under the German occupation. However, in the part of Poland under their control, the Soviets nationalized large Jewish businesses and factories, confiscated and collectivized land, ended any semblance of Jewish political and social autonomy, and deported the "hostile class element" to Siberia. These policies impacted the general population as well.

            Eastern Poland during the interwar period was home to many Ukrainians as well as Jews. This accounted for the efforts of the Polish government to "polonize" the area.

            The Soviets drafted a number of Jews from Brody into the Red army. In total, about half a million Jews served in the Red army during World War II, and approximately 200,000 fell in battle. Some 160,000, including Mr. Ferber, were awarded medals for bravery. The German invasion of the Soviet Union came as a great shock to Stalin, who believed that Hitler would honor the August 1939 non-aggression treaty signed between the two countries. News of German atrocities against Jews in their zone of occupation from 1939-1941 was deliberately withheld from Soviet Jewry who were unprepared for the Nazi onslaught, as was the Red army which was overwhelmed in the early phase of the brutal war. The battle of Stalingrad, lasting from late summer 1942 until the German surrender on February 2, 1943, marked the turning point of the war on the eastern front.

            Chernevtsky was a town located in western Ukraine. It was occupied by Romania, Germany's World War II ally. During the Romanian occupation, the Jews of Chernevtsky were persecuted and ghettoized, and their population was decimated.

            About 165,000 Polish Jews were repatriated under the Polish/Soviet repatriation agreement of July 1945. Some 20,000 went back to Poland under a subsequent agreement. About seven percent of the prewar Polish Jewish population was saved within the Soviet Union. Belzec and Treblinka were Nazi extermination camps designed to annihilate the Jews of the General Government. Auschwitz was the largest of the extermination camps and also a concentration camp. It had some forty subcamps. Like Mr. Ferber, many survivors experienced the loss of their entire families.

            Zakopane was located in the Kraków district of Poland. It was a Carpathian mountain community with a Jewish population of several hundred. During the 1930's, there were a number of anti-Semitic incidents in the town. Polish anti-Semitism also manifested itself after the war despite the small number of Jewish survivors. Some three million Polish Jews perished during the Holocaust, and about 300,000 survived.

            Nowy Targ had a pre war Jewish population of over a thousand, which also suffered from anti-Semitism in the interwar period in the form of economic boycotts and occasional violence. Anti-Semitic agitation revived after the war, directed at the handful of survivors.

            In the immediate postwar period, the communist regime in the People's Republic of Poland allowed the Jewish survivors a degree of social and cultural autonomy. Those Jews with communist sympathies had hopes for full assimilation, and Jewish communists occupied some posts in the new government. The new regime, under the control of the Stalinist Soviet Union, was anything but democratic.

            General Anders headed an army of Polish exiles formed in the Soviet Union following the Nazi invasion. Eventually this army made its way out of the Soviet Union via Iran and fought with the Allies against the Germans. After the fall of France, the Polish government-in-exile moved to London where it remained for the duration of the war. This government did not have the welfare of Polish Jewry as its highest priority. Nevertheless, it transmitted funds contributed by Jewish organizations to Polish Jewry, and its public pronouncements eventually played a significant role in dispelling doubts in western countries about Nazi genocide.

            The mufti (Islamic religious head) most associated with anti Jewish activities was Haj Amin Al Husseini, the grand mufti of Jerusalem. During the interwar period, he became the head of the Palestinian Arabs. The mufti had an uncompromisingly negative attitude towards Jewish settlement in Palestine and agreed with Nazi ideological goals aimed at the destruction of "world Jewry." During World War II, he pursued Arab national political goals and gave active support to the Nazi genocide against European Jewry.

            Soon after the end of the Second World War, Churchill's Conservative party was defeated in general elections and was succeeded by Clement Atlee's Labour party. At the time, Great Britain continued to control Palestine and enforce the terms of its May 1939 White Paper which greatly restricted Jewish emigration. Ernest Bevin was Foreign Secretary in the Labour government. He pursued an oppressive policy towards the Palestinian Jewish community and deported would-be Jewish immigrants to detention camps in Cyprus. After his proposals for the solution of the conflict between Arabs and Jews failed, he referred the entire matter to the United Nations. In January, 1949, eight months after the proclamation of the State of Israel, he granted it Britain's de facto recognition.

            More than 6,000 Poles have been honored with the award, Righteous Among the Nations, for their efforts in rescuing Jews during the Holocaust by Yad Vashem, Israel's official Holocaust memorial and museum.

            Palestinian Jewry worked throughout Europe in Aliyah Bet, the dedicated effort to bring European Jewish Holocaust survivors to Palestine in spite of British immigration restrictions. Thus it may defined as "illegal" immigration. France became a key center for directing these immigration operations, which became a unifying force in the Jewish world and came to enjoy widespread sympathy in the world at large.

            In fact, especially by the late 1930's, anti-Semitic attitudes had become widespread among the Soviet elite and were held by many in the general population. Throughout the war, the Jews were not recognized as special victims of Nazi genocide, and this concealment continued after the war. From 1948 to 1953, the Black Years of Soviet Jewry, anti-Semitism became one of the chief policies of the Stalinist regime.

            The Polish perpetrators of the Kielce pogrom on July 4, 1946 massacred forty-two Jews in the town of Kielce in southeastern Poland and wounded fifty more. The pogrom was sparked by a rumor that Jews were killing Polish children and drinking their blood. This event sparked a mass exodus of tens of thousands of Jews from Poland and other countries of eastern Europe who despaired of rebuilding productive and secure lives there.

            She'erit ha-Peletah ("surviving remnant") is a term taken from First Chronicles 4:43. This was the Hebrew name given to the organization of Holocaust survivors, most in displaced persons' camps, following the war. The organization's primary goals were emigration of Jews from Europe primarily to settle in Palestine. It existed from 1945 until December, 1950 when its Central Committee ceased to exist.

            A number of biblical commandments stress the importance of providing for orphans and treating them with justice and compassion. These commandments were reinforced in the Talmud and translated into Jewish communal care for orphans throughout the centuries.

            Brody (Yid. Brod) was in the Tarnopol district of Poland (then southeastern Poland, now northwestern Ukraine). The town was a center of nineteenth century Jewish progressive thinking and had a strong Zionist movement. In September, 1939, the Soviets occupied the city, but the Germans took over shortly after the beginning of their invasion of the Soviet Union on June, 22, 1941. During the German occupation, the Jews of Brody were terrorized, persecuted, ghettoized and then murdered. Only about 250 of the 9,000 Jews in Brody on the eve of World War II survived.

            Located in southern Poland, the historic city was for several centuries the capital of the early Polish kingdom. Jewish settlement in Kraków dates from at least the early fourteenth century. During the German occupation, the city became the seat of the Nazi General Government run by the notorious Hans Frank.

            In fact, the Soviet Union occupied eastern Poland in accordance with a secret protocol in the Nazi Soviet pact signed on August 23, 1939 between the foreign ministers of the two totalitarian powers. The protocol called for the division of Poland between them by force of arms.

            Treatment of the Jewish population under Soviet rule was certainly better than under the German occupation. However, in the part of Poland under their control, the Soviets nationalized large Jewish businesses and factories, confiscated and collectivized land, ended any semblance of Jewish political and social autonomy, and deported the "hostile class element" to Siberia. These policies impacted the general population as well.

            The Soviets drafted a number of Jews from Brody into the Red army. In total, about half a million Jews served in the Red army during World War II, and approximately 200,000 fell in battle. Some 160,000, including Mr. Ferber, were awarded medals for bravery. The German invasion of the Soviet Union came as a great shock to Stalin, who believed that Hitler would honor the August 1939 non-aggression treaty signed between the two countries. News of German atrocities against Jews in their zone of occupation from 1939-1941 was deliberately withheld from Soviet Jewry who were unprepared for the Nazi onslaught, as was the Red army which was overwhelmed in the early phase of the brutal war. The battle of Stalingrad, lasting from late summer 1942 until the German surrender on February 2, 1943, marked the turning point of the war on the eastern front.

            About 165,000 Polish Jews were repatriated under the Polish/Soviet repatriation agreement of July 1945. Some 20,000 went back to Poland under a subsequent agreement. About seven percent of the prewar Polish Jewish population was saved within the Soviet Union. Belzec and Treblinka were Nazi extermination camps designed to annihilate the Jews of the General Government. Auschwitz was the largest of the extermination camps and also a concentration camp. It had some forty subcamps. Like Mr. Ferber, many survivors experienced the loss of their entire families.

            Zakopane was located in the Kraków district of Poland. It was a Carpathian mountain community with a Jewish population of several hundred. During the 1930's, there were a number of anti-Semitic incidents in the town. Polish anti-Semitism also manifested itself after the war despite the small number of Jewish survivors. Some three million Polish Jews perished during the Holocaust, and about 300,000 survived.

            In the immediate postwar period, the communist regime in the People's Republic of Poland allowed the Jewish survivors a degree of social and cultural autonomy. Those Jews with communist sympathies had hopes for full assimilation, and Jewish communists occupied some posts in the new government. The new regime, under the control of the Stalinist Soviet Union, was anything but democratic.

            General Anders headed an army of Polish exiles formed in the Soviet Union following the Nazi invasion. Eventually this army made its way out of the Soviet Union via Iran and fought with the Allies against the Germans. After the fall of France, the Polish government-in-exile moved to London where it remained for the duration of the war. This government did not have the welfare of Polish Jewry as its highest priority. Nevertheless, it transmitted funds contributed by Jewish organizations to Polish Jewry, and its public pronouncements eventually played a significant role in dispelling doubts in western countries about Nazi genocide.

During the interwar period, he became the head of the Palestinian Arabs. The mufti had an uncompromisingly negative attitude towards Jewish settlement in Palestine and agreed with Nazi ideological goals aimed at the destruction of "world Jewry." During World War II, he pursued Arab national political goals and gave active support to the Nazi genocide against European Jewry.

            Soon after the end of the Second World War, Churchill's Conservative party was defeated in general elections and was succeeded by Clement Atlee's Labour party. At the time, Great Britain continued to control Palestine and enforce the terms of its May 1939 White Paper which greatly restricted Jewish emigration. Ernest Bevin was Foreign Secretary in the Labour government. He pursued an oppressive policy towards the Palestinian Jewish community and deported would-be Jewish immigrants to detention camps in Cyprus. After his proposals for the solution of the conflict between Arabs and Jews failed, he referred the entire matter to the United Nations. In January, 1949, eight months after the proclamation of the State of Israel, he granted it Britain's de facto recognition.

The pogrom was sparked by a rumor that Jews were killing Polish children and drinking their blood. This event sparked a mass exodus of tens of thousands of Jews from Poland and other countries of eastern Europe who despaired of rebuilding productive and secure lives there.
