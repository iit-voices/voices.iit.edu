Day in and day out . . . the whole day, we had to [run] down and up with stones. When we got up there with the large stones and had put down those stones, we had to run down on the double into the quarry. And we received beatings from the German <a class="term" href="#vothG_capo">capos</a> and from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> men. And that was day in, day out, day in, day out. The people . . . our comrades . . . Jews ran at the head of the formation. We had no more hope of holding out and sought death. It was this. The sentries who stood around would shoot at everybody who came near them or who wanted to run through. And very many of our people were murdered by suicide, or were forced by the <a class="term" href="#vothG_capo">capos</a> to find death . . . to seek [death] because it was too hard. After a year and a half I got into a detail. <a class="placename" href="#vothC15" type="camp">Buchenwald</a> started to be built up. Barracks began to be erected. I started working at masonry as handy man, as helper. I was helping. We carried lime up three stories. We carried bricks. We also carried stones, and we were beaten. And when we, after that very hard day, returned to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>, every day we were so beaten up we couldn't move. And yet we had to stand for <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a> on the <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a> square.

Whatever was the hardest was done by the Jews. The Jews had to act as [word not clear], as . . . as horses to pull carts. And this was also very hard. The Jews were so beaten and the carts were so loaded that we couldn't pull them. All day long one only heard at the dray columns, 'One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Left, two, three, four.' All day long. The people were so beaten. Then it was in the year '42 that a training school opened for the masonry apprentices. And Jews were entered in this school. They were taught masonry. Two hundred . . . two hundred Jews reported they wanted to become masons. And one nice day, during the <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>, it was ordered, 'All Jews remain on the <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a>.' When other details had pulled out, the Jews had to stand.

The Jews, tradesmen, had to begin working as masons. And they were building factories [word not clear], factories where later on arms were also manufactured.

Who is sending us to Palestine? They gave us nothing to eat. They gave us one bread for eight for a whole day. The Germans could receive packages. We could not receive any letters or send letters to anyone. And thus we were tortured for three months, morally. They interrogated us for twenty-five hours at a time. They had us in the bunker. They conducted the investigation in a special locality [name not clear]. I can't now . . . I can't recollect at the moment what the name of that locality was. Various officers interrogated us. They undressed us completely nude during the search. We had it still worse than in the concentration camp. Only [however]the feeling that we Jews who had the fortune to be liberated are imprisoned together under one roof with the biggest war criminals, that was the worst. Among us was a girl who had married, and she was already in the eighth month. And they did not even want to send her to the hospital or to set her free. In the case when a German woman [was] only in the third month or the fourth, she was immediately set free. But not us. By an accident a Jewish captain, an Englishman, found out that here were imprisoned Jews. And that was our luck.</span>

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.

Their skeletal faces were devoid of expression, and they seemed to have been overcome by despair and by the absence of the will to live. The origin of the term has not been definitively established, though it has been attributed to a certain similarity to a prostrate Muslim in prayer.
