            Thessaloniki or Salonika was home to the most flourishing Sephardic Jewish community in the world before the Holocaust. Nearly all of its prewar Jewish population of some 56,000 perished in the Holocaust,  most of them in Auschwitz-Birkenau.

            Because their ancestors were originally from the Iberian peninsula, some Greek Sephardic Jews were able to obtain Spanish citizenship.

            The Baron Hirsch neighborhood in Salonika was one of the three neighborhoods in the city that comprised the Jewish ghetto. Since the it was close to a key railroad station, the neighborhood became the departure point for Jews being  deported to extermination and concentration camp centers.

            The first rail convoy to Auschwitz-Birkenau departed on March 15, 1943. Subsequent convoys left in the following weeks. The last convoy left Salonika on August 10,1943.

            The rumor Mr. Button heard about "an extinction at work" was unfortunately accurate. Most of the at least 43,850 Jews from Salonikia who arrived at Auschwitz-Birkenau between March and August, 1943 were gassed on arrival.

            The German army occupied Athens on September 8, 1943 following Italy's capitulation. On October 7, 1943, an order was issued for all Jews in Athens to register with the community. There  was a very limited response, and the following month all Jewish property was confiscated in retaliation for the poor registration showing. Some Jews in Athens joined partisan groups. Most went into hiding although by March 1944 about 1,500 had registered either to receive permission to work or out of fear of reprisals against Christian neighbors who were sheltering them.

            At the outset of the Italian occupation of Athens, there were some 3,500 Jews in the city. This number rose to 8,000-10,000 due to Jews who escaped to Athens from German and Bulgarian parts of occupied Greece. Among these escapees were Mr. Button and his family. On March 25, 1944, the Germans rounded up 1,690 Jews from Athens ( a number of them refugees from Salonikia) for deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau.

            The Haidary concentration camp was located in the town of Haidary near Athens. It operated from September 2, 1943 to September 20, 1944. The majority of Haidary's inmates were transported to Bergen Belsen or to Auschwitz.

            This promise was not as empty as it sounds. The Franco government did agree to take Jews with Spanish citizenship but stipulated that they could only remain temporarily on Spanish soil. Only when one group had left the country could another be admitted. This policy greatly restricted the number of Jews who were admitted to Spain during the course of the war.

            Germany occupied Hungary on March 19, 1944. A special commando headed by Adolph Eichmann was part of the occupying force. Its task was to implement the "Final Solution" program. The Germans installed a collaborationist government which rapidly issued a host of anti-Jewish decrees including the wearing of the yellow star.

            Mr. Button is referring here to the last months that the camp was in existence as conditions deteriorated  dramatically due to the influx of tens of thousands of prisoner evacuees and a typhus epidemic. From January to mid-April 1945, some 35,000 prisoners perished in the camp. Mr. Button and others in the "neutral camp" suffered during this time but were still afforded better treatment than the majority of the inmates as seen by Mr. Button's subsequent testimony regarding the cruelty and brutality he witnessed in Belsen during the winter of 1945.

            The Jewish Committee for Social Action and Reconciliation, an arm of the organized French Jewish community, was able to provide food and shelter for some three quarters of the approximately 40,000 Holocaust survivors who came to France following their liberation.

            At the time, Palestine was under the control of the British who severely restricted Jewish immigration. Like other survivors, Mr. Button had lost his home, his business, his belongings and the cultural and religious milieu into which he was born and was attempting to make a new life for himself and his family.

                Established in the spring of 1943 and initially intended as a transit camp, it soon was integrated into the concentration camp network.  Its population swelled late in the war as inmates from other camps further east were moved into it--from around 15,000 in late 1944 to 41,250 in March 1945.

            Thessaloniki or Salonika was home to the most flourishing Sephardic Jewish community in the world before the Holocaust. Nearly all of its prewar Jewish population of some 56,000 perished in the Holocaust,  most of them in Auschwitz-Birkenau.

            The Baron Hirsch neighborhood in Salonika was one of the three neighborhoods in the city that comprised the Jewish ghetto. Since the it was close to a key railroad station, the neighborhood became the departure point for Jews being  deported to extermination and concentration camp centers.

            The German army occupied Athens on September 8, 1943 following Italy's capitulation. On October 7, 1943, an order was issued for all Jews in Athens to register with the community. There  was a very limited response, and the following month all Jewish property was confiscated in retaliation for the poor registration showing. Some Jews in Athens joined partisan groups. Most went into hiding although by March 1944 about 1,500 had registered either to receive permission to work or out of fear of reprisals against Christian neighbors who were sheltering them.

            At the outset of the Italian occupation of Athens, there were some 3,500 Jews in the city. This number rose to 8,000-10,000 due to Jews who escaped to Athens from German and Bulgarian parts of occupied Greece. Among these escapees were Mr. Button and his family. On March 25, 1944, the Germans rounded up 1,690 Jews from Athens ( a number of them refugees from Salonikia) for deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau.

            This promise was not as empty as it sounds. The Franco government did agree to take Jews with Spanish citizenship but stipulated that they could only remain temporarily on Spanish soil. Only when one group had left the country could another be admitted. This policy greatly restricted the number of Jews who were admitted to Spain during the course of the war.

            Germany occupied Hungary on March 19, 1944. A special commando headed by Adolph Eichmann was part of the occupying force. Its task was to implement the "Final Solution" program. The Germans installed a collaborationist government which rapidly issued a host of anti-Jewish decrees including the wearing of the yellow star.

            Mr. Button is referring here to the last months that the camp was in existence as conditions deteriorated  dramatically due to the influx of tens of thousands of prisoner evacuees and a typhus epidemic. From January to mid-April 1945, some 35,000 prisoners perished in the camp. Mr. Button and others in the "neutral camp" suffered during this time but were still afforded better treatment than the majority of the inmates as seen by Mr. Button's subsequent testimony regarding the cruelty and brutality he witnessed in Belsen during the winter of 1945.

Like other survivors, Mr. Button had lost his home, his business, his belongings and the cultural and religious milieu into which he was born and was attempting to make a new life for himself and his family.
