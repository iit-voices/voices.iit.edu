So there were three groups. What we saw made one's heart ache terribly. Just to see how these people treated us, that on one motion, on one gesture of a German man depended the fate and life of a person. If he made with the hand so, or so, [she demonstrates] that meant he would go for deportation from which nobody returned. My uncle with the three children stood on the side for deportation, while his wife with my mutti were working together. And he cried terribly and the children around him held on to his arms and they all cried terribly, and they yelled to me that I should transmit regards to his wife, and he didn't know that I too was being sent to a <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. He thought I will see his wife and he pleaded with me that I should console her, that he will return, that he will protect the three children and nothing will happen to them. And we saw his face and the little children and I will never forget it. There stood next to him a man whom I also knew very well. He was an acquaintance from our city who stood there with nine children. The oldest child was eleven years old. His wife also remained in the same city where my mutti worked; most of the women remained there.</span>

I was very beautiful. [Here she stops and blushes and then continues the sentence]. I was very beautifully sunburned, because for the last half year I worked in the fields for the Germans outdoors all day, and so he said that surely I was fit to go to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. I didn't say a word. I couldn't defend myself, I still stood there and my heart ached. I wanted badly that the two brothers should go home, because I was sure that Mutti will come home. I didn't know that the same thing happened in the other city. That we got to know only later. And there stood the other brother, the eighteen-year-old one, before the doctor. And the doctor recognized him. He was the one who let him go two weeks ago from <a class="placename" href="#vothC25" type="camp">Dachau</a>. He recognized him. It was a Pole and he asked him, 'What are you doing here? I have set you free.' And my brother said, 'What can I do? We had a selection and I had to go and my leg is not yet well.' He said, 'I shall give you a note and you can go back home', and he was put aside with the people who were to go home and then came the little one before the doctor. I pleaded with him that he should set the little one free, that he wasn't yet 14 years old, only 13. He should permit him to go home so he could be with Mutti and the other brother. He is still a child and he wouldn't be able to get along. But the doctor said: 'Since I have set free one, I cannot set free the other.' And we had to agree. Because the inspector of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. Knoll, a German and an <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> man, had called all the Jews to the square. He could free them; he could send them to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. And he [the doctor] told my brother that he should stand right in front and because he is so small possibly something fortunate might happen. They may notice that he was small and he will be set free. He had beautiful hair, golden curls, but he didn't obey, it was something new for him. [Mockingly] He goes to a <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. He doesn't understand what it means. He goes to a <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> that's a new life for him.

But afterward the rooms were again put in order and they told us that none of us would dare have more than a pair of stockings, a pair of underthings or more than one shirt. We should not dare to have more than what is being given to us. And that was for us a big blow because we were not accustomed to such conditions. Anything that we had from home was so dear to us, because these were the only tokens of remembrance. And it was difficult during the war to make something. Still they have ruined everything without heart, without anything. And everything they have ruined. And they liked to see it so. And they told us to get on with our work. We were on the night shift. Without food, without sleep, without washing ourselves. Still they told us to go on to the factory. Go on with our work as usual. And there came a very strong winter, and we had to stand at the machinery that was thousands of times bigger than ourselves. Terribly big machinery, without help, without anybody, in frost, and in hunger; and we had to stay there and work. Twelve hours, from six o'clock in the morning until six o'clock in the evening.

I paid no attention, I thought it would heal in a couple of days. I have been working in dust, because there was a terrible dust. That was the worst thing. That was because this dust got into our noses and our lungs. We could not talk or breathe there. We couldn't even see each other, so much dust there was around. So the dust got into that little wound; it became larger. She is showing me now a scar on her right leg about two inches long, and an inch and a half wide]. And so, this wound became bigger from day to day. Pus developed and I had a temperature of 40[centigrade] and had to stay in bed. I thought that in a week or two that will get well. Still it lasted two and a half months. I could not walk. I was very weak, and so I remained in bed for two and a half months.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="#nichthauserF" start="2656.597" end="x">For example, we belonged to the concentration camp <a class="placename" href="#vothC39" type="camp">Gross-Rosen</a> and everything that happened in our <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> had to be made known to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_commandant">commandant</a> of <a class="placename" href="#vothC39" type="camp">Gross-Rosen</a>. For example, every day there went over a list of the sick and also of the ones who were well and able to work. And so my name went there often, almost every day during the two and a half months. I am sick, constantly sick, and they didn't like it very much because I remained so long in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> so there came an order that I should be sent to the <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a> crematory because I am unfit for work and it is impossible to keep me longer. They didn't tell me that. They knew how sensitive I was. They were afraid that I would do something; they didn't tell me anything. Only after liberation I was told that I was to be sent within a few day to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>; and all were very grieved and still they couldn't do anything and it surely would have happened that way. Within a few days there came an order that all girls, that means the whole <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> had to go to transport. It was again one of those times when all the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lagers</a> were dissolved and again people were driven away because the Russians were already near. And so we, the sick, had to get up and those who were well also had to get up, and we had to pack all our things, everything we had. We were given a little piece of bread, a bit of margarine, a bit of marmalade, and so we started on foot to transport, and we didn't know where to. And we were marching thirty-five kilometers a day without a stop, without a halt for rest, without anything with <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> men, with soldiers, with all the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> women who were with us, and so we were driven day and night, day and night.</span>

They would have killed us if they would have known that we have made these things. And then, on the day of the transport when she saw that we have these things on us she did not care anymore. She was already leaving the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. And that was in part our salvation because it was terribly cold, and we outdoors. One night we came to a village where they permitted us to sleep in a barn. But we were five hundred girls and barely one hundred and fifty could get in. The rest remained outside. So we lay down on the cobble-stones and on the snow. It was just a miracle that many did not fall asleep forever. And so we marched and marched until we came to Yanoff. I don't know where it is; I just know the name of the city. There they put us in railroad cards, but such cold cars, open gondolas, dirty. Where barely eighty people could get on, they put one hundred and fifty of us in each car. We were lying one on the other; we were yelling. We began to cease being human because we knew it was just impossible otherwise. We would shout at each other: "Move on! Make room!" We had to talk rudely to each other; it just didn't go otherwise. They did it all on purpose so that we should become mean to each other. Well, we did not beat each other, but it wasn't far from it. And the conditions were terrible. In general no food, and traveling day and night. It was snowing and we were wet through and through. The soldiers and <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> men had a separate car. Not a passenger car, but a closed one and there they had a stove, not an electrical, but just a stove, and there they cooked, and prepared various things. They drank coffee and we had to look on. And so we traveled for several days. When we stopped at a station we asked permission of the woman <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> commander to wash ourselves, because we haven't washed ourselves for already two, three weeks. When the trip was first on foot she permitted us to wash, and it was January. We undressed and we went into the pond. So we washed ourselves in icy, ice-cold water. She marveled at us. Everybody marveled at us. They didn't want to believe that we were Jews. All that they have heard was that the Jews are dirty. They are unfit to keep clean. The young and beautiful girls had to use such water! With a knife we had to break through the ice so that we could wash a little bit. We cleaned our things and returned to the dirty railroad car. So we traveled several weeks again without food, without anything. They gave us some cold preserves without bread, without anything. It was salty. No water. It really was a miracle . . . One asked a soldier to give us from a pump or a well some water! At every station there was so much water but they wouldn't permit us to fetch it. Sometimes when the train was standing we went over to the locomotive and we
                        scooped up that dirty water, oily warm water. It was so greasy from the oil but we grabbed it so nobody would see us and we drank that water, that dirty water. One night we arrived in <a class="placename" href="#vothC8" type="camp">Belsen</a>. We stood there in the open. We arrived there at three o'clock at night. We were told we had first to bathe because they were afraid we may have lice. So we, five hundred girls divided into five groups, and each group went separately and they let the girls out from different doors so that they could not talk to us and could not tell us anything what they had been doing, so that we could be prepared. And that precisely was bad. And then my turn came. We were undressed completely naked, we were permitted to take only our shoes.</span>

They put them on a stick and the things went into a special oven where they were disinfected so no lice should remain on them, although we had no lice at that time. They undressed us and told us that we will get out things back. So we went in bathing. We wanted to take a shirt or something else for a towel but they did not permit us to do it. We went in just so, only the shoes we could take. But at that time we had no good shoes. Mine were big, very big wooden shoes. Three pair of feet like mine could go into one such shoe, with which I have worked already for months in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, and these we could take with us. I still had some pictures from home, from my mutti, from my papa, and from my brothers and sisters and many, many other pictures. But I specially wanted to take with me those of my family. They didn't permit me to do so. They immediately burned it all except for a few small pictures that I hid deep in the shoe so that they could not find them. I saved these few pictures which are so precious to me, and are full of deep memories. And so I went bathing under the shower and there were men present. They laughed, they mocked us, they went amidst the wet bodies and they . . . [here she said she couldn't find a German expression and just showed what they were doing slapping herself on the buttocks]. And for the bathing they took us into a hall where the water was frozen on the walls. And no towels were given, no soap, we just washed ourselves, that way in the water and we stood in that hall for hours, and waited until the things came from that oven, from disinfection. That is how we dried ourselves. The water on our hair froze to the head, and the drops of water froze on us. We huddled ourselves to each other so that we could warm ourselves a bit. We really could not believe that people could do such things to us, move us after such very hot water to such a cold hall, where there was only water and frost. We had to get dry by ourselves. I was all blue from the cold. So we waited two hours until our things came and they were really not our things that came. I did not get my dress but a dress that belonged to another girl, and to the other girl they gave in turn my things. Everything was mixed up. We got a shirt, a pair of pantaloons and a dress. They did not permit anything more. Everything else we had to abandon. So we went at night, deep in the night, late in the night to the barracks. We were chased and beaten, so we should go faster.</span>

We didn't know the way to the barracks. It was very far from the bathhouse. We arrived in the barracks and it was ptich dark. We couldn't see the door or nothing. They pushed us in like pigs. Locked us up and went away. And so in the dark we looked for some bed, for a table. One couldn't find anything. But on the next morning, when daylight appeared, we saw that the room was empty, that we had nothing. We had only the floor and the walls. Broken glass in the windows, and the wind blew from all sides. We sat down on the dirty floor and our life started anew. From January to April, I was in <a class="placename" href="#vothC8" type="camp">Belsen</a>. But these couple of months cost me much more than the three and a half years spent in other <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lagers</a>. In the other <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lagers</a> I could wash myself, we did not suffer from hunger, we could go around clean, I could keep my things still in order. Here we were five hundred girls in one barracks. Soon arrived five hundred more two hundred more, one hundred more, everyday . . . Hungarian poeple, Russian people, all kinds. Old people, healthy people and sick people. All together, one next to the other. One had lice, the other did not have any, so now she had lice too. And so it was. Horrible, horrible.

There was a special list made of us. The rest died from typhus or from sheer dirt. I too came pretty close to it. I remember the day when I saw the first lice on myself. On my blouse. I couldn't believe it, I cried like a little child. I had never lice on me and I couldn't believe it. Other people had lice, but I shouldn't have had any. And so the others, near to whom I was sitting laughed at me! 'today you have one, tomorrow you will have two, in a week you will have thousands!' And so it was. And then I didn't have any more strength to remove the lice from me. They crawled over me like ants . . .</span>

But at night I couldn't sleep. We were not sleeping with our legs stretched out. We slept sitting up because there was no room. People were sitting in rows, back to back. The legs, just very little space for them. So we sat for months, for weeks without food. At the end we didn't get any bread; for six weeks we had no bread. Only a little bit of soup if you could call that soup. Water with turnips and without salt. Once a day a very small cup, and we had still to fight for it. And there were terrifying scenes. So frightful. There were my girl friends with whom I was in the other <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. Such beautiful girls, young girls. In the other <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> we sometimes enjoyed a bit of humor, we danced, even gave some plays. There were very gifted girls among us. I too was one of them. For instance I arranged various theatricals. If a girl had a birthday, for example, we always would arrange something. And we sang or put a little verse together so we could bring about a bit of joy. And that all passed through my memories while I was in <a class="placename" href="#vothC8" type="camp">Belsen</a>. And I saw the same girls who danced with me, who were so gay before, so full of will to live in spite of the hard life. Then we still believed in freedom. Now one after the other died. At the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> where I was, the face of every girl near dead was so changed, I could recognize that such a girl will die in a few minutes. Only from hunger and from filth. How often was I called, I should come over! People, the called. ''Come over to me!' I couldn't do it because I felt my heart would break. One was unable to see the person. Just the eyes. Eyes and lice. One didn't see anything else but lice. And all in tatters, no clothes.</span>

My body was covered with wounds. It was terrible. We did not believe that I will get it over. Many girls, many of my girl friends went insane. People were yelling at night: 'Where am I?' They were calling, mama. They were calling brother. They were calling. One had to hold one's ears, not to listen to such screams.

Beautifully dressed in such a trim <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> costume and a stick in her hand and a large dog. And she would come to us every day and before she would arrive we had to wait for her three, four hours. From eight in the morning to eleven in the morning, we were called to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appell</a> square without washing, without food, without anything.

It grew from a small paramilitary unit to a powerful force that served as Hitler's "Praetorian Guard," the Nazi Party's "Shield Squadron" and a force that, fielding almost a million men (both on the front lines and as political police), managed to exert as much political influence as the German Army. Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
