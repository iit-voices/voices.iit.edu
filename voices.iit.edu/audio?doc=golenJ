    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "0.630","u": "Germany, Wiesbaden, September the 26th. I think I marked yesterday the records &#34;the 26th&#34; so I will have to make a correction. I am really overstaying my time [intelligible?] and they can&#39;t send me one anyway before . . . eight o&#39;clock tonight. I am . . . it is Rosh Hashanah and the Jewish community is in the synagogue&#226;the synagogue which I&#39;ve been told has not yet been officially dedicated but has of course Rosh Hashanah services in . . . after the chaplain has said . . . what&#39;s the chaplain&#39;s name?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "39.231","u": "Darling."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "39.711","u": ". . . as Chaplain Darling from the United States Army, Chaplain Darling has said, it&#39;s after seven years the first Rosh Hashanah service in the synagogue. I am taking time out. I am tempted to go over there and take part in the services later but I&#39;m taking time out since I have here with me Mr. Judah Golen, a representative of the Jewish agency of Palestine,&#226;for Palestine&#226;and since I have met a number of these men and women . . . often in Italy and France on railroad trains and so on . . . I have decided to take out this morning out and he has graciously agreed to tell us something about the work of the representatives of the Jewish Agency for Palestine which, according to him, has about a hundred people working in the various DP camps. Also, Mr. Golen, would you be so kind first of all to tell who you are and then let&#39;s go on with the story. The microphone is yours for as much time as you want."},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "98.948","u": "Well, um, I myself am a Palestinian. Born in Palestine, Jerusalem; the son of parents who were born in Palestine&#226;and the grandson of grandfather and grandmother who were born in Palestine. I had my education in Palestine and in Great Britain&#226;in England. I am an advocate by profession . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "125.334","u": "A what?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "125.904","u": "An advocate."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "126.744","u": "A lawyer."},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "127.704","u": ". . . by profession but I am also attached as a legal advisor to the political department of the Jewish Agency. I have volunteered a few months ago to go to Europe and see what one can do for the remnants of the Jews who are still in Europe. My object is really to be in Austria and establish there the connections, and the machinery, for dealing with the Jews who are there and who are passing from Eastern Europe to the Western side with an idea to come later to Palestine."},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "171.520","u": "[inaudible] . . . wait a minute . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "173.230","u": "..go ahead."},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "174.040","u": "I want to . . . My object is to stay as I said in Austria and open there first of all a Palestine office. The . . . I&#39;m going to have a small mission of some fifteen men and women from Palestine who would be spread all over Austria to the various camps&#226;in the various camps&#226;and do first of all the cultural and instructive work among the DPs. The, um, to tell you how the whole thing started it would be a rather a long story but the first . . . Jews who arrived in Europe during the war and immediately after . . . victory were the Jews from Palestine who served in the Jewish brigades which is now known all over the world. They were the first who reached the remnants of our brothers and succeeded in getting to a far point in&#226;within Russia itself. They then organized and helped those Jews to come over to the Allies and . . . rather Western side of Europe. Would you stop the . . ."},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "262.858","u": "Now, uh, after the Jewish brigade had to leave Europe and go back to Palestine for demobilization the Jewish Agency for Palestine decided to send a number of Jewish shluchim which called really &#34;messengers&#34; from Palestine to the Jews in Europe. The Jewish Agency has contacted the UNRRA . . . UNRRA authorities who are very sympathetic and who assisted in having a number of Jews from Palestine come over to Europe. The JAFP&#226;which means the Jewish agency for Palestine is now in Europe&#226;in Germany&#226;as a separate unit attached to the UNRRA. There are now about a hundred of such men and women doing work in the various camps, among the DPs in conjunction with UNRRA."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "323.565","u": "May I ask a question? How is that financially handled?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "326.445","u": "Well, the Jewish agency pays their expenses as to if a man has to get his salary for example, he is paid by the Jewish agency. On the other hand the UNRRA keeps the men in Germany and covers, as many other members of the UNRRA, their economic and traveling expenses. I wouldn&#39;t say all traveling expenses&#226;a major part is being paid by the Jewish Agency. But various facilities are sympathetically given by the UNRRA. . . . another question?"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "360.917","u": "No. Go ahead."},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "362.477","u": "So, the hundred of men and women are spread all over Germany&#226;British and American Zones. As I said I don&#39;t want . . . I want to limit myself to my own function."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "373.877","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "374.117","u": "My immediate object is to leave for Vienna in a few days and come in contact there with UNRRA authorities in Vienna and Austria so that we can establish a unit of the Jewish Agency in Austria. &#34;What are these men and women from Palestine doing in the camp?&#34; First of all, one should realize the mental and physical situation of the Jews who arrived a few months ago from Poland and who are coming here with strong stream from Poland and even Russia."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "413.718","u": "Excuse me, when you speak &#34;arrived a few months ago from Poland&#34; you speak about those what the UNRRA calls &#34;infiltrees&#34;"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "420.228","u": "That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "421.908","u": "Well, are you interested only in the &#34;infiltrees?&#34;"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "423.978","u": "No, no we are&#226;our men are mainly stationed in the various DP camps where you have . . . I mean . . . there&#39;s a man or who is coming to a DP camp is a member of an UNRRA team and his duty is to do for these DPs whatever the UNRRA would tell him. But as there are Jews from Palestine, they have the ability and possibility to deal in more cultural work for the Jews in the DP. They are also serving as instructors in various&#226;I would say&#226;in vocational work. We have organized in various . . . around some camps in Germany kind of . . . groups of youth&#226;Jewish youth, who are taking agricultural and other training. We have . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "476.075","u": "Agriculture . . . ?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "476.675","u": "Agricultural . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "477.425","u": "Isn&#39;t that done with the ORT&#226;in conjunction with the ORT?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "479.795","u": "It is done with-in conjunction with the ORT in full harmony and in conjunction and with the full help with all AJDC and other Jewish and certainly not forget the UNRRA . . . help."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "492.245","u": "AJDC is the American Jewish Agency?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "494.495","u": "No. It&#39;s America Joint . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "495.875","u": "American Joint . . ."},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "497.465","u": ". . .

The connection between the Jewish Agency and the AJDC in Europe is rather strong and as far as I could see from the last two or three weeks I have been in Munich&#226;in Munich, in Germany&#226;the relations are very good. I have met a great number of AJDC men and ORT men and I see that in one respect, in respect of helping the brothers&#226;all our own brothers&#226;the men on the [spot?] have understood that is one thing and that is harmony among the workers so that the Jews who are here should only gain by the presence of such an organization. Now . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "554.421","u": "Mr. Golen I think you have made here an interesting point. There are two schools of thought some people constantly kick that there is duplication&#226;that too many different agencies do the same thing. Just to say personally I want to say right now that I don&#39;t agree with that. What do you think?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "580.356","u": "Well I associate myself with your view. I don&#39;t think there is duplication. &#39;A:&#39; I consider that there is a lack of men all over. . . . of Jews from more liberated countries like America, Palestine, France, England who can do a great deal for those people who are in the DPs. But as to the question of duplication I don&#39;t consider that duplication. What we, the Jewish Agency, is doing now is &#34;A:&#34; . . . the language which is Jewish and the Hebrew language is common with the Jews who come from Poland. Many, many of those Jews do not know English or any other language in which they could converse with the people who come from America. The Jewish Agency is establishing schools with the aid of the AJDC&#226;the teachers come from Palestine. Some money and other help is being given by the other institutions. The Hebrew language is being taught to the children and other subjects are being taught in Hebrew."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "643.072","u": "Excuse me another point for interrupting I know it is terrible nuisance. What money is considered? Would you say the money comes exclusively from America?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "654.022","u": "Well, I would not say that. Although I would say a great deal of money is coming from America . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "658.702","u": "But . . ."},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "659.092","u": " But I, from my own experience in Palestine, I know that they have many collections being organized among the Jewish population who count now about 650,000 in Palestine and I know practically every Jew in Palestine has been contributing to these various Jewish institutions whose object is also&#226;I mean who includes in that program helping the Jews in the Diaspora. I know that during the war the first, I would say, the first who succeeded in sending over help in money and in other ways&#226;I mean in clothing and books and so on to Europe, to the people who were still in the . . . under the enemy regime, were the Palestinians. But I would not say that they did it themselves. It&#39;s known and I know it from my own personal knowledge that the AJDC . . . helped a great deal. I mean they really supplied the money and the Jews of Palestine found a way to send it over, with their own money collected from Palestine, to the ghetto in Warsaw . . . to Poland and to other places in Europe when the Germans were still there."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "733.465","u": "Nu. Continue."},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "734.995","u": "&#34;Now, what is the Jewish . . . ?&#34; I do not&#226;I am not confident to speak for the AJDC as I am not a member. I can only say . . . speak from my own experience that what I saw . . . the various action or the various help&#226;aid&#226;which is being given by the AJDC is greatly appreciated and it should continue. What I can say is more about the JAFP which is as I said a separate unit in the UNRRA&#226;within the UNRRA. Now . . . as I said there are hundreds already in Pales&#226;Germany, both zones, British and American. As far as I know the UNRRA are very, very satisfied with these men because . . . mentally they know how to approach DPs. And the DPs whose aim throughout the war and before the war and now, was Palestine, which they considered the only . . . as I said at the time -wartime- the only thing which remained for them was to go to Palestine. They would take a Jew from Palestine more into their confidence than any other person. Also the question of the language which is more common between the Palestinian Jew and the Jew from Poland whether it&#39;s Yiddish or Hebrew because I see I am really surprised to see a great number of Jews coming from Lithuania, Poland and other countries in Eastern Europe speak fluently Hebrew&#226;speak fluent Hebrew&#226;which is again a sign of attachment to the Jewish people and to Palestine. Would you like to know anything?"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "835.033","u": "Yes. Well . . . So let us continue about this . . . Let me ask you this question: &#34;In your impression&#226;you mentioned the poor&#226;do all DPs, all displaced Jews, or all of we couldn&#39;t say, but what do you estimate? What percentage of the DPs and which age groups long for Palestine and which one would want to go to America, South America, Australia, South Africa and other places?&#34; You couldn&#39;t say that everyone wants to go to Palestine?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "867.118","u": "Well I&#39;ll you exactly how it is&#226;I&#39;ll tell you. Immediately after the war and during the war, as far as I know in my conversations with various Jews in various camps, Palestine was the only light which really gave them some energy to . . . stand and to wait until victory comes. I admit that there has been some disappointment among many Jews because external difficulties&#226;we cannot ignore the various political difficulties existing in Palestine and outside. The Jews are not the only masters of Palestine and they could not bring over so many Jews as they wanted. But . . . and these difficulties naturally caused the various Jews in Europe to feel bitter at the time against those elements who did not allow them to come to the place where they longed and they thought they belonged. There may be quite a number of Jews who now, after seeing these difficulties, try to find another place to [?] and to have some peace&#226;peace of mind and peace of body. People move for South Africa where they have relatives there, people move for America&#226;especially the United States&#226;I . . . and people certainly move for Palestine. These are I would say apart from&#226;and you may have some Jews who would like to go to Australia. I consider that all those Jews who do want to go to places outside of Palestine are Jews who have some relatives in there and some hope that they would be able to enter a new life in those countries. As far as I see prospects are not very large. Neither America, although America has shown a great&#226;what should I say&#226;great generosity . . . I can&#39;t . . . whether this is the word . . . towards accepting Jews into their land. This would not solve the problem because the problem is a matter of, at least now, two hundred thousand Jews who are now in Austria and German zones&#226;not to mention the Jews who are expected here from Poland."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1002.195","u": "What is your estimate of the Jewish population of Europe now&#226;Poland included?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "1006.365","u": "Poland included . . . ?"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1007.835","u": ". . . counting England. The Jewish population of Europe?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "1010.385","u": "Oh . . . they are considered to be a million and . . . a million and two hundred thousand Jews all over Europe&#226;including Rumania, Hungaria&#226;Hungary, Greece . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1020.945","u": "Yeah."},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "1021.245","u": ". . . we&#39;re very few there. But, uh . . . and Poland . . . I would say that Germany&#226;both the British and American zone and Austria have now two hundred thousand Jews."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1032.165","u": "Uh-huh. Does the Russian zone have displaced Jews?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "1036.755","u": "No, no. There are many Jews who do come from Russia and said they have crossed the Russian zone to . . . they come from Russia to Poland and from Poland they come to . . . the Russian zone and from there to Czechoslovakia or to other countries and then they come over to the American zone. This is, the American zone, is the . . . I would say now the immediate ideal of many Jews to come to because, &#34;A:&#34; the kindness shown by the American authorities literally and civilly is so great that people think they can stay here for a while until they come to a more permanent station. This should be really stressed. The, as far as I could know, from people who were in straight&#226;in direct from connections with the various authorities here, I mean the Americans&#226;the Americans have shown great deal of understanding of the Jewish problems and Jewish difficulties and a great deal of help has been given them physically I would say and spiritually. If you would like to know more about the actions of the JAFP, which is the main object . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1103.252","u": "Yes, well if you&#39;d please . . ."},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "1105.142","u": "Now the various messengers of Zion who come to the various camps, first thing they do is to organize the Jews in their more cultural work.

It is more a body of . . . with which the British mandate-ery has to consult with matters connected with the building of the Jewish national home in Palestine. They have to say about the certificates, certainly, because the . . . .I would say the practice is that the British government or rather the administration in Palestine&#226;[?] in Palestine approves every now and then number of . . . as they call it a &#34;schedule&#34;&#226;a number of immigrants who are allowed to come to Palestine when . . .

Out of that they deduct a number&#226;usually it is about . . . I would say when it is . . . it&#39;s over a hundred anyhow to non-Jews&#226;whether Arabs or other Christians who would like to come to Palestine."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1266.577","u": "And what is the monthly quota altogether for Palestine?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "1266.577","u": "Well it has been, for the last I would say . . . eighteen months, it has been fifteen hundred."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1277.828","u": "A month?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "1278.514","u": "A month."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1279.109","u": "Yeah."},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "1279.674","u": "This proved to be a figure which cannot satisfy&#226;I wouldn&#39;t say even satisfy&#226;it&#39;s really just, it cannot serve the purpose&#226;it even causes more bitterness because it is a crumble of last piece of bread of hungry people who are trying to find some . . . some place. Well, as to the question of certificates, for example, the fact that a number of Jews succeeded in getting into Palestine&#226;not waiting for the granting of these certificates they had no patience, they had no power to wait, no strength to wait&#226;these certificates which were supposed to be given to the Jewish Agency were to be deducted on that account so that for the last three months the Jewish agency has not received any certificates for the purpose of bringing over Jews from the . . . Europe.

The Jews in Palestine, as I&#39;ve said before&#226;after having experienced so many atrocities all over the world, all over history, have decided to be in some respect the masters of their own life and in this respect they have organized without even any . . . instigation on the part of any leadership but within themselves they have organized themselves into a defense force. This defense force is comprised of practically every Jew who is able to give a hand in the defense machinery. Their object is certainly not aggressive&#226;it has never been aggressive&#226;they have proved their . . . the right of their existence in the various riots which took place since they have tried to come back to Palestine. They never meant to take anything away from others by force&#226;whether it&#39;s land, whether it&#39;s property, whether it&#39;s any other right or ownership. What the thing is . . . the idea is to keep whatever they have got for themselves and not to allow others to take it away which we have seen in so many&#226;so many times to have been carried out. The haganah has been appearing in the various [press?] and has been heard all over the world as a result of the last act being carried out in Palestine. One should distinguish the haganah from any other terrorist or from any terrorist organization. The haganah it would not be justified it would be entirely incorrect to call the haganah a &#39;terrorist organization.&#39; It&#39;s true, there are some . . . there are two organizations who would be . . . would consider themselves . . . terrorists in the sense of attacking British property or rather Palestinian government property. These are young men who experienced hardships out of Palestine, who psychologically were badly influenced as a result of what had gone over . . . what has passed from themselves and from their parents. Young men who lost their families and who hoped to be able to establish themselves in Palestine after experience . . . experiencing so many disappointments as a result of political difficulties they have gone over to accuse the British in that and from the point of accusing they have also tried to carry out certain terrorist acts as I said, destroying property of the British. They are not in the sense of&#226;there are differences even between themselves&#226;but they are not under any Jewish organization or Jewish authority.

I would say the Arab nation as a whole is not so much afraid of the Jews who want to come to Palestine as it&#39;s being tried to be . . . as people try to show it. It&#39;s true that there are a number of Arab leaders who consider it their duty to arise within the Arab population such fears but from experience till now we know that the more the Jews&#226;the more Jews arrive in Palestine the better off were the Arabs in Palestine, economically&#226;and not only economically&#226;socially, politically, and many other respects. One thing should be clear, clearly told. Palestine is not and cannot be a country for one nation only. Palestine was the cradle of three religions, Palestine is the land of many nations, and Palestine originated . . . [?] origin the Jewish people and various other nations. It cannot be the land of one nation. This has also been establish by the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. In this sense what the Arabs say that &#34;no Jew has any right to this country called Palestine&#34; is, I would say, a mistake and a historical mistake. The Jews say that they cannot&#226;they will never displace any Arabs from their country but to that I would like to add that every Jew has a right to this country as long as no Arab is being displaced and the intention of the Jews is to come to Palestine and develop the country in such a way that would let both people live peacefully . . . each at the side of the other."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "5033.914","u": "By &#34;developing&#34; you mean they will reclaim a narrow fruitless land [themselves?]?"},    {"who": "Judah Golen", "start": "5039.222","u": "They have . . . certainly. Palestine is a neglected country. It has been neglected for the last few hundred years. History shows us that Palestine used to be a most . . . one of the most fruitful countries in the Middle East. It had millions of population about two thousand years ago. And with energy, finance, work, and strong rule Palestine can return to its original situation. The Jews who have come to Palestine during the last fifty years have mainly developed neglected land. Such land as can be found. The Jews own now only six percent of the land of the country. So you have another 96 . . . 94%. Out of that you have some land belonging to the Arabs, developed by them, more extensively than the Jewish development but in addition to that you have large tracts of land entirely neglected. You have almost half the size of Palestine which is called the Negev&#226;the southern part which is now a desert. The Jews claim it and they hope to be able to reclaim it. That means to develop the land, to plant there, they have already a few stations there&#226;kind of an experimenting station . . . where they try to find water by all means&#226;scientific means&#226;in their hands. And they have proved already a success. In the middle of the desert down south of Palestine near the Sinai, near the [?] you have Jewish settlements where no person thought of any possibility to plant trees there and to sew crops there. Now they are gathering the fruit very happily. We have remnants of old towns in the times of the Crusades there, which shows that this desert was once inhabited.

I am taking time out. I am tempted to go over there and take part in the services later but I&#39;m taking time out since I have here with me Mr. Judah Golen, a representative of the Jewish agency of Palestine,&#226;for Palestine&#226;and since I have met a number of these men and women . . . often in Italy and France on railroad trains and so on . . . I have decided to take out this morning out and he has graciously agreed to tell us something about the work of the representatives of the Jewish Agency for Palestine which, according to him, has about a hundred people working in the various DP camps. Also, Mr. Golen, would you be so kind first of all to tell who you are and then let&#39;s go on with the story. The microphone is yours for as much time as you want.</p>

I have volunteered a few months ago to go to Europe and see what one can do for the remnants of the Jews who are still in Europe. My object is really to be in Austria and establish there the connections, and the machinery, for dealing with the Jews who are there and who are passing from Eastern Europe to the Western side with an idea to come later to Palestine.</p>

I&#39;m going to have a small mission of some fifteen men and women from Palestine who would be spread all over Austria to the various camps&#226;in the various camps&#226;and do first of all the cultural and instructive work among the DPs. The, um, to tell you how the whole thing started it would be a rather a long story but the first . . . Jews who arrived in Europe during the war and immediately after . . . victory were the Jews from Palestine who served in the Jewish brigades which is now known all over the world. They were the first who reached the remnants of our brothers and succeeded in getting to a far point in&#226;within Russia itself. They then organized and helped those Jews to come over to the Allies and . . . rather Western side of Europe. Would you stop the . . .</p>

                    <p class="utterance">Now, uh, after the Jewish brigade had to leave Europe and go back to Palestine for demobilization the Jewish Agency for Palestine decided to send a number of Jewish shluchim which called really &#34;messengers&#34; from Palestine to the Jews in Europe. The Jewish Agency has contacted the UNRRA . . . UNRRA authorities who are very sympathetic and who assisted in having a number of Jews from Palestine come over to Europe. The JAFP&#226;which means the Jewish agency for Palestine is now in Europe&#226;in Germany&#226;as a separate unit attached to the UNRRA. There are now about a hundred of such men and women doing work in the various camps, among the DPs in conjunction with UNRRA.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">Well, the Jewish agency pays their expenses as to if a man has to get his salary for example, he is paid by the Jewish agency. On the other hand the UNRRA keeps the men in Germany and covers, as many other members of the UNRRA, their economic and traveling expenses. I wouldn&#39;t say all traveling expenses&#226;a major part is being paid by the Jewish Agency. But various facilities are sympathetically given by the UNRRA. . . . another question?</p>

The connection between the Jewish Agency and the AJDC in Europe is rather strong and as far as I could see from the last two or three weeks I have been in Munich&#226;in Munich, in Germany&#226;the relations are very good. I have met a great number of AJDC men and ORT men and I see that in one respect, in respect of helping the brothers&#226;all our own brothers&#226;the men on the [spot?] have understood that is one thing and that is harmony among the workers so that the Jews who are here should only gain by the presence of such an organization.

                    <p class="utterance">Mr. Golen I think you have made here an interesting point. There are two schools of thought some people constantly kick that there is duplication&#226;that too many different agencies do the same thing. Just to say personally I want to say right now that I don&#39;t agree with that. What do you think?</p>

                    <p class="utterance">Well I associate myself with your view. I don&#39;t think there is duplication. &#39;A:&#39; I consider that there is a lack of men all over. . . . of Jews from more liberated countries like America, Palestine, France, England who can do a great deal for those people who are in the DPs. But as to the question of duplication I don&#39;t consider that duplication. What we, the Jewish Agency, is doing now is &#34;A:&#34; . . . the language which is Jewish and the Hebrew language is common with the Jews who come from Poland. Many, many of those Jews do not know English or any other language in which they could converse with the people who come from America. The Jewish Agency is establishing schools with the aid of the AJDC&#226;the teachers come from Palestine. Some money and other help is being given by the other institutions. The Hebrew language is being taught to the children and other subjects are being taught in Hebrew.</p>

                    <p class="utterance"> But I, from my own experience in Palestine, I know that they have many collections being organized among the Jewish population who count now about 650,000 in Palestine and I know practically every Jew in Palestine has been contributing to these various Jewish institutions whose object is also&#226;I mean who includes in that program helping the Jews in the Diaspora. I know that during the war the first, I would say, the first who succeeded in sending over help in money and in other ways&#226;I mean in clothing and books and so on to Europe, to the people who were still in the . . . under the enemy regime, were the Palestinians. But I would not say that they did it themselves. It&#39;s known and I know it from my own personal knowledge that the AJDC . . . helped a great deal. I mean they really supplied the money and the Jews of Palestine found a way to send it over, with their own money collected from Palestine, to the ghetto in Warsaw . . . to Poland and to other places in Europe when the Germans were still there.</p>

I can only say . . . speak from my own experience that what I saw . . . the various action or the various help&#226;aid&#226;which is being given by the AJDC is greatly appreciated and it should continue. What I can say is more about the JAFP which is as I said a separate unit in the UNRRA&#226;within the UNRRA. Now . . . as I said there are hundreds already in Pales&#226;Germany, both zones, British and American. As far as I know the UNRRA are very, very satisfied with these men because . . . mentally they know how to approach DPs. And the DPs whose aim throughout the war and before the war and now, was Palestine, which they considered the only . . . as I said at the time -wartime- the only thing which remained for them was to go to Palestine. They would take a Jew from Palestine more into their confidence than any other person. Also the question of the language which is more common between the Palestinian Jew and the Jew from Poland whether it&#39;s Yiddish or Hebrew because I see I am really surprised to see a great number of Jews coming from Lithuania, Poland and other countries in Eastern Europe speak fluently Hebrew&#226;speak fluent Hebrew&#226;which is again a sign of attachment to the Jewish people and to Palestine.

                    <p class="utterance">Yes. Well . . . So let us continue about this . . . Let me ask you this question: &#34;In your impression&#226;you mentioned the poor&#226;do all DPs, all displaced Jews, or all of we couldn&#39;t say, but what do you estimate? What percentage of the DPs and which age groups long for Palestine and which one would want to go to America, South America, Australia, South Africa and other places?&#34; You couldn&#39;t say that everyone wants to go to Palestine?</p>
                                                                                                <b>Judah Golen</b>
                    <p class="utterance">Well I&#39;ll you exactly how it is&#226;I&#39;ll tell you. Immediately after the war and during the war, as far as I know in my conversations with various Jews in various camps, Palestine was the only light which really gave them some energy to . . . stand and to wait until victory comes. I admit that there has been some disappointment among many Jews because external difficulties&#226;we cannot ignore the various political difficulties existing in Palestine and outside. The Jews are not the only masters of Palestine and they could not bring over so many Jews as they wanted. But . . . and these difficulties naturally caused the various Jews in Europe to feel bitter at the time against those elements who did not allow them to come to the place where they longed and they thought they belonged. There may be quite a number of Jews who now, after seeing these difficulties, try to find another place to [?] and to have some peace&#226;peace of mind and peace of body. People move for South Africa where they have relatives there, people move for America&#226;especially the United States&#226;I . . . and people certainly move for Palestine. These are I would say apart from&#226;and you may have some Jews who would like to go to Australia. I consider that all those Jews who do want to go to places outside of Palestine are Jews who have some relatives in there and some hope that they would be able to enter a new life in those countries. As far as I see prospects are not very large. Neither America, although America has shown a great&#226;what should I say&#226;great generosity . . . I can&#39;t . . . whether this is the word . . . towards accepting Jews into their land. This would not solve the problem because the problem is a matter of, at least now, two hundred thousand Jews who are now in Austria and German zones&#226;not to mention the Jews who are expected here from Poland.</p>

There are many Jews who do come from Russia and said they have crossed the Russian zone to . . . they come from Russia to Poland and from Poland they come to . . . the Russian zone and from there to Czechoslovakia or to other countries and then they come over to the American zone. This is, the American zone, is the . . . I would say now the immediate ideal of many Jews to come to because, &#34;A:&#34; the kindness shown by the American authorities literally and civilly is so great that people think they can stay here for a while until they come to a more permanent station. This should be really stressed. The, as far as I could know, from people who were in straight&#226;in direct from connections with the various authorities here, I mean the Americans&#226;the Americans have shown great deal of understanding of the Jewish problems and Jewish difficulties and a great deal of help has been given them physically I would say and spiritually.

                    <p class="utterance">They don&#39;t have it in Russia because the Jewish Agency has not been able to establish direct connections with the Russian government till now. If you ask me why, I can&#39;t tell you. Better ask the Russians for this purpose. But we have it in Sweden, we have it in Germany now, in Munich, we have it in other towns around the American zone. Where there is the Palestinian office&#226;a Palestinian office&#226;who do the examining work, who should get a certificate, and who is . . . who should be able to proceed to Palestine immediately under those certificates. As I said, unfortunately, the number of certificates is so small that it&#39;s become rather . . . the certificate is less important than anything because of its . . . the difficulty of getting it . . . because of its non-existence, I would say. The Palestinian offices have now almost no work to do. But the Jewish Agency is establishing these Palestinian offices with the hope that certificates would be granted&#226;in a greater number&#226;and then the work would start again. &#34;What are the Palestinian offices doing exactly and how do they give the certificates?&#34; There are various categories: &#34;A:&#34; there are relatives in Palestine like fathers who have their sons in Europe or husbands who have left their wives in Europe&#226;these have the priority. Again, you have sons who have their parents, sisters who have their brothers&#226;these have, again, the priority. After that comes the efficiency of the man. You have the various movements&#226;youth movements&#226;who organize their members in various works, [so it should be?] as I&#39;ve said before, these kibbutzei                         hachshara. When a kibbutz                         hachshara.or a group of youth shows itself able and . . . able to go to Palestine, they are given a collective certificate I would say, that means each one is given&#226;is being given a certificate. And the group goes over to Palestine as a group. There, they are immediately absorbed in one of the settlements so that the economic question is not existing at all. Again you have, before the war we had also a category of &#34;capitalists.&#34; That we, as Jews who owned over a thousand pounds, were allowed to be given&#226;were allowed to come to Palestine under such certificate. These were also distributed in conjunction with the Jewish Agency. But government itself&#226;British government&#226;could also give certificates for people without even consulting the Jewish Agency (as to this question of these capitalists). We have also &#34;professional certificates.&#34; Doctors and other professional . . . professions who would receive certificates in the same way as capitalists received certificates. The . . .</p>

                    <p class="utterance">Yes, certainly. The Jewish Agency&#226;the executive of the Jewish Agency&#226;when they receive this schedule, this number of certificates sit down in Jerusalem after consulting the various Palestinian offices in the various countries and decide how many certificates should be sent to the various . . . .offices. So that they, at the time when the certificates are available, they take into consideration the immediate necessity of the number of certificates needed to a certain place. If, for example, during the war, there was hope to help and to save Jews from Rumania they then sent a greater number of certificates to Rumania at that time. Even now the Agency of certificates would . . . the Agency would be seen more in Germany than in any other place, certainly the number of certificates for the German people&#226;for the I would say . . . sorry . . . for the . . .</p>

For example, according to the law&#226;the immigration law in Palestine&#226;I would say persons mentally unfit would not be able&#226;are not allowed to come into Palestine. But, Palestine has absorbed a great number of people who are invalids as a result of the war and who are&#226;who have become weak in health as a result of the war. On the contrary, they are even given more consideration and are being helped more in social . . . in a social respect than those who don&#39;t need this help. I know, for example, being myself in Haifa when a boat of . . . arrived. Most of the people were really physically not well. This is not because . . . this was only as a result of the war. Now I understand that these people are healthy people, and doing their work as any other Jew does work in Palestine.</p>

It is Rosh Hashanah. The Jewish community, maintained by the UNRRA, is having its first Rosh Hashanah services which they are rebuilding with their own hands. And which has been seven years ago, according to Capt. and Chaplain Darling, desecrated. But I am taking advantage of the morning to get some additional material although I would like to record at least a part of the services which I still may do. My interviewee is Mr. Golen a Palestinian-born, a third generation Palestinian, who is working with the Jewish Agency for Palestine here. We have covered all of spool 160 and I am going over now to spool 161. Illinois Institute of Technology wire-recording in the general study of displaced people in Europe without distinction of race or creed. Also, I want to ask you a question about the kibbutz . . . kibbutz.hachshara. I was in Italy . . . they have there self-government. I saw in one room 36 young people. Men and women together, well that is common for all UNRRA camps. They let the Mennonites who seem to be the best organized live men, women, and children together in one barrack. It is not particular to the Jews but it seems to have been . . . and it is not on their fault, so to say, but let me ask you this question . . . Now let&#39;s come back and take that what hurts us most: thirty-six young people in one room. Married couples when they are without children also in that same room. Sometimes the cots moved together, sometimes two people in one cot. Of course it&#39;s all better than it was in the German concentration camp but &#34;what do you think is the influence and the significance of such life?&#34; &#34;And what can be done in general about it?&#34;</p>

There is no such thing as living families in the same room together. No human being likes that&#226;it&#39;s against human nature&#226;and these young boys and girls if they do conduct a life together in&#226;as you saw, said you saw in Italy&#226;I can assure you, even without my having been there, that it&#39;s out of difficulty to sheer necessity to get separate rooms. The idea of the kibbutz, of the collective . . . life in the collective form, is not&#226;is not to eliminate and forget the individual element. Not to . . . merge your individuality into the collective. It&#39;s to give to the collective whatever you can give and take from it whatever you have to take.

No. Only when he comes home and if he still has, even though let&#39;s say if the woman works&#226;if the woman has to prepare food and to do other things, she has no time to give to her child. While in the kibbutz the child is being taken care [of] by special nurses, or I call them &#34;mothers&#34; because they are members of the kibbutz who have their own children and the other children in these children houses. In the evening, the worker&#226;the member of the kibbutz, whether it&#39;s a mother or a father they come back they have their meal immediately and then they have the evening till the time the children have to go to sleep dedicated to their children, in education (to see that the children prepare their lessons if they are grown-up children), if they are babies they play with them in the little fields there and the most interesting picture in the kibbutz would be if you come at a certain hour let&#39;s say it&#39;s five o&#39;clock in the evening you would see couples, parents, playing with their own children for an hour and two hours and you would see the parents let&#39;s say it&#39;s seven o&#39;clock in the evening or half-past seven you see the typical picture of the kibbutz is children on the shoulders of their fathers being taken to the children house to sleep and say goodbye&#226;goodnight&#226;to their father. In the morning the parents, if they have time, they see their children immediately&#226;[that] their children are getting up.

This general meeting&#226;the general meeting of the members is the deciding factor in the kibbutz. This is, I would say, the top of democracy expressed in these kibbutzim. The general meeting elects once a year a committee of some nine to ten members according to the size of the kibbutz according to the number of the kibbutz and each member has a job to do, each member . . . is doing a certain part of the work of the kibbutz&#226;I mean is rather in charge of a certain part of the kibbutz. There is one member who is in charge of the cultural work of the kibbutz[what the occasions were?], there is one other member who would be in charge of the distribution of work in the farm. There is one who would be in charge of connections with outside, there is one who be in charge of the business side of the kibbutz.

Let&#39;s take this: Suppose a member of the kibbutz has a watch to repair and an other member of the kibbutz has learned in the art of somewhere watch-making, repairs it for him. Can one pay to the other privately for it?</p>

                    <p class="utterance">No. There&#39;s no such thing as money as I said and members do not have money. But, if a member has a watch and he has to repair it, the kibbutz will pay for repairing that watch either in town or in the kibbutz. That means if a man knows the work of watch-repairing or watch-making in the kibbutz, he will not be paid, it will be his profession and he gets for the work he does his food and his clothing and his health service and he&#39;s being taken care of by the various people around&#226;he should have been taken care of&#226;for that he gives his work, whatever he can do whether its watch-making or whether its another way. He will not pay his friend. &#34;A:&#34; his friend will not ask for money, &#34;B:&#34; the kibbutz is responsible to the watch to run smoothly and they will pay for the repairing expenses.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">A-ha. Now let me tell you, the executives of the kibbutz, do they get paid?</p>

                    <p class="utterance">No. There is no such thing as &#34;paid&#34; at all in the kibbutz. The kibbutz as a whole is paid with the outside market&#226;if they sell their goods or their food, they get money. For this money the committee buys things for the members of the kibbutz. And they get it directly without having money pass through the hands of each individual. There is no need for money because you can do nothing for money. If he goes to town, he is being given an amount sufficient to . . . have him . . . to make him able to spend a fortnight or three weeks in town. Usually members of the kibbutz have their leave once a year for a fortnight or three weeks . . .</p>

                    <p class="utterance">There is no such thing as &#34;parasite&#34; because, as I said there is no law and order but there is a public opinion in the kibbutz which would not let a member sit in doing nothing.

Public opinion would not allow a member&#226;and as I said only public opinion&#226;there&#39;s no such thing as rule, there&#39;s no such thing as thing as punishment, no such thing as fine and there&#39;s no such thing as requesting openly from a member to do his job. Public opinion is the ruling power and I would say, the moving spirit of the whole running of the kibbutz. And a member would not be able to see around him working men while he does nothing. He will have to do a job. If he is sick then it is the duty of the kibbutz to take care of him, even if he is sick for more than a month or two months. I know members who stayed in a kibbutz two years and they unfortunately became ill, they got TB as a . . . from some . . . result or another and they are being taken care of for years without doing any work. The kibbutz pays thousands of pounds a month for members to be cured in some resort or some other place; in Palestine or outside. I know even of members who have been sent to Switzerland to be cured at the expense of the kibbutz. Members who stayed in the kibbutz only two or three months but who proved their desire to work in the kibbutz and the kibbutz feels it&#39;s a duty to take care of its members.</p>

The first who established it was Joseph Trumpeldor who was killed in the north of Palestine by Arabs at the time. He came up with the idea that Jews cannot and should not rely on others especially when such others are not existent or when such others are not wishing to help. They should rely on themselves.

                    <p class="utterance">Well it seems that the politics are not always as they say . . . everywhere and are not always to be understood so swiftly and directly. If the British have some interest in Palestine they would&#226;in order to carry out such interest, in order to come to the object of what they have they would recruit people who they think would serve their own purpose better. You ask &#34;why don&#39;t they recruit Jews&#226;the Jewish people in Palestine&#226;for that purpose?&#34; The question is what is the purpose? At wartime when there was the war they tried to recruit as many Jews as they were able to&#226;to put them to the front. And many, many Jews&#226;over thirty-five thousand Jews joined the British Army and fought in all fields&#226;in Europe, in North Africa, Syria and other places. Now, if the British authorities try to recruit men&#226;it means to, they think, to keep order in the Middle East and they would certainly like to have British people more than Jewish people from Palestine.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">The word haganah itself means defense&#226;self defense. The Jews in Palestine, as I&#39;ve said before&#226;after having experienced so many atrocities all over the world, all over history, have decided to be in some respect the masters of their own life and in this respect they have organized without even any . . . instigation on the part of any leadership but within themselves they have organized themselves into a defense force. This defense force is comprised of practically every Jew who is able to give a hand in the defense machinery. Their object is certainly not aggressive&#226;it has never been aggressive&#226;they have proved their . . . the right of their existence in the various riots which took place since they have tried to come back to Palestine. They never meant to take anything away from others by force&#226;whether it&#39;s land, whether it&#39;s property, whether it&#39;s any other right or ownership. What the thing is . . . the idea is to keep whatever they have got for themselves and not to allow others to take it away which we have seen in so many&#226;so many times to have been carried out. The haganah has been appearing in the various [press?] and has been heard all over the world as a result of the last act being carried out in Palestine. One should distinguish the haganah from any other terrorist or from any terrorist organization. The haganah it would not be justified it would be entirely incorrect to call the haganah a &#39;terrorist organization.&#39; It&#39;s true, there are some . . . there are two organizations who would be . . . would consider themselves . . . terrorists in the sense of attacking British property or rather Palestinian government property. These are young men who experienced hardships out of Palestine, who psychologically were badly influenced as a result of what had gone over . . . what has passed from themselves and from their parents. Young men who lost their families and who hoped to be able to establish themselves in Palestine after experience . . . experiencing so many disappointments as a result of political difficulties they have gone over to accuse the British in that and from the point of accusing they have also tried to carry out certain terrorist acts as I said, destroying property of the British. They are not in the sense of&#226;there are differences even between themselves&#226;but they are not under any Jewish organization or Jewish authority. And the Jewish institutions openly and sincerely oppose to such and undisciplined, and I would say unwise, acts being carried out by these young men.</p>

                                                                                                <b>Judah Golen</b>
                    <p class="utterance">I as a Jew consider that there is ample opportunity and possibility of having peace in Palestine&#226;only and . . . only if the Jews are given the right to come to Palestine. I would say the Arab nation as a whole is not so much afraid of the Jews who want to come to Palestine as it&#39;s being tried to be . . . as people try to show it. It&#39;s true that there are a number of Arab leaders who consider it their duty to arise within the Arab population such fears but from experience till now we know that the more the Jews&#226;the more Jews arrive in Palestine the better off were the Arabs in Palestine, economically&#226;and not only economically&#226;socially, politically, and many other respects. One thing should be clear, clearly told. Palestine is not and cannot be a country for one nation only. Palestine was the cradle of three religions, Palestine is the land of many nations, and Palestine originated . . . [?] origin the Jewish people and various other nations. It cannot be the land of one nation. This has also been establish by the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. In this sense what the Arabs say that &#34;no Jew has any right to this country called Palestine&#34; is, I would say, a mistake and a historical mistake. The Jews say that they cannot&#226;they will never displace any Arabs from their country but to that I would like to add that every Jew has a right to this country as long as no Arab is being displaced and the intention of the Jews is to come to Palestine and develop the country in such a way that would let both people live peacefully . . . each at the side of the other.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">They have . . . certainly. Palestine is a neglected country. It has been neglected for the last few hundred years. History shows us that Palestine used to be a most . . . one of the most fruitful countries in the Middle East. It had millions of population about two thousand years ago. And with energy, finance, work, and strong rule Palestine can return to its original situation. The Jews who have come to Palestine during the last fifty years have mainly developed neglected land. Such land as can be found. The Jews own now only six percent of the land of the country. So you have another 96 . . . 94%. Out of that you have some land belonging to the Arabs, developed by them, more extensively than the Jewish development but in addition to that you have large tracts of land entirely neglected. You have almost half the size of Palestine which is called the Negev&#226;the southern part which is now a desert. The Jews claim it and they hope to be able to reclaim it. That means to develop the land, to plant there, they have already a few stations there&#226;kind of an experimenting station . . . where they try to find water by all means&#226;scientific means&#226;in their hands. And they have proved already a success. In the middle of the desert down south of Palestine near the Sinai, near the [?] you have Jewish settlements where no person thought of any possibility to plant trees there and to sew crops there. Now they are gathering the fruit very happily. We have remnants of old towns in the times of the Crusades there, which shows that this desert was once inhabited. What we want is to inhabit those neglected settlements again without affecting in any way the people who are already in Palestine.</p>

And these younger boys of the Mizrachi have established settlements&#226;religious settlements&#226;that means where they can practice their religion and they can carry on with their work without any body interrupting them. When I say without any body interrupting them it doesn&#39;t mean in other settlements religion is being interrupted. On the contrary&#226;in every settlement, practically every settlement, you have a shul&#226;a synagogue&#226;where all the parents go to pray and where the younger people whoever want, can go and pray.

That means not to cause a religious person any suffering. No [?], what you call&#226;no &#34;open smoking&#34; should be practiced where there are religious Jews. And in the religious settlements, certainly, there is no question of smoking on Saturday because they keep Sabbath fully and to the last point. But even in town Jews . . . I can&#39;t say that the Jews wouldn&#39;t smoke on Shabbat&#226;they will smoke on Shabbat but they would see to it that none smoke it or rather that religious Jews should not see it.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">No doubt about that. I think that Palestine in this respect has shown a great deal of tolerance. On the one part the religious Jews understand that they cannot make every Jew religious by force, they are trying to preach&#226;to induce opportunity to be more religious, but they don&#39;t use force. There is a small force of younger, fanatic religious Jews who try to interrupt the traffic on the eve of Shabbat but they are really a very negligible part of the whole and really can&#39;t be taken into consideration. In general, as far as I can say from my own experience, tolerance is one of the main . . . I would say . . . characteristics of Palestine. I don&#39;t want to . . .</p>
