They did not want to let them remain simply laying shot down on the street; and so they [the exhausted prisoners] were loaded on a truck and together with the dead; they were then shot in the nearest forest and buried with them.

There was a definite policy of the Nazis in Eastern Europe, at least at the beginning of the war, to bleed the occupied countries and the ghettos of their intellectual manpower. In a perfideous fashion calls were made for academically trained people with the alleged purpose to put in order the city archives, libraries, etc. Prisoners were zealously competing for these assignments, and the interviews gave the appearance of strict selective examinations. But the &#39;lucky&#39; winners of these contests were in many cases secretly assigned for direct extermination [Kovno Ghetto] ] .</p>
