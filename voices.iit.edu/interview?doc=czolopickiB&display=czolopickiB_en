The Home Army was joined by the smaller People's Army, a leftist Polish resistance organization which included some Jews who had fought in the Warsaw Ghetto rebellion of April 19-May 16, 1943. The aim of the uprising was to seize the city of Warsaw before the approaching Red Army could conquer it. The unequal struggle ended on October 2, 1943 with the defeat of the insurgents.During the uprising some 150,000 civilians were killed including several thousand Jews who had been living in hiding in "Aryan" Warsaw after the collapse of the Warsaw Ghetto rebellion and some 16,000-20,000 Polish insurgents.</span><sup><a href="#note_1">1</a></sup></note></span>

            The Polish uprising against the German occupiers of Warsaw began on August 1, 1944. It was led by the Polish Home Army, allied with the Polish government-in-exile in London. The Home Army was joined by the smaller People's Army, a leftist Polish resistance organization which included some Jews who had fought in the Warsaw Ghetto rebellion of April 19-May 16, 1943. The aim of the uprising was to seize the city of Warsaw before the approaching Red Army could conquer it. The unequal struggle ended on October 2, 1943 with the defeat of the insurgents.During the uprising some 150,000 civilians were killed including several thousand Jews who had been living in hiding in "Aryan" Warsaw after the collapse of the Warsaw Ghetto rebellion and some 16,000-20,000 Polish insurgents.

            The Rhineland is located in western Germany and is named for the Rhine river. After World War I, it was a buffer zone between Germany and the West with Allied troops occupying it from 1918-1930. It was then a demilitarized zone until occupied by Germany in 1936. Though this occupation was in defiance of the Versailles Treaty, there was no meaningful Allied response to it in keeping with the policy of appeasement at the time.

            With the collapse of the Polish uprising, the Germans expelled the bulk of the population of Warsaw to nearby detention camps and razed what was left of the city. About 100,000, including Mr. Czolopicki, were conscripted for forced labor, 65,000 were sent to concentration camps and the rest were deported  to the Generalgouvernement, the Polish administrative unit established by the Germans in October, 1939 and comprised of those parts of the country not incorporated into the Third Reich.

            Bochum is located in northwestern  western Germany  northwest of the city of Essen and in the heart of the Ruhr district, the industrial heartland of Germany and one of the world's largest single industrial regions with ironworks, steelworks and coal mines.

            Essen is located in northwestern western Germany. It was the largest industrial city in the Ruhr coalfield. It suffered a great deal of destruction from Allied bombing during World War II as a center of the German war industry.

            In early March, 1945, General Eisenhower's armies began an all-out advance towards the Rhine during which Mr. Czolopicki was liberated.

            It is unclear to which party Mr. Czolopicki is referring since at this time Germany was a one party Nazi (National Socialist German Workers Party) state established in 1933. The Storm troopers of the party wore brown uniforms.

            Moers is a town located in the Ruhr just west of Duisberg. It is west of the Rhine river. American troops did not cross the Rhine until March 7, 1945. Contrary to what is indicated in the interview, Moers is not over the Rhine.

            Mr. Czolopiciki indicated earlier that he had begun studying at a school for design. It was for this school that he was paying. He then switched to the study of radio. There is no indication as to which organization was paying for his training in this area. It is possible that he was enrolled in an ORT training program.

            Was  Mr. Czolopicki living under an assumed name because he was Jewish or because as a non-Jewish able-bodied Polish male he feared deportation by the Germans for forced labor? The battle of the Warsaw Ghetto, the first urban uprising in German occupied Europe, was the longest of any Jewish uprising against the Germans.

            <a name="note_12"></a>
            It is interesting that Mr. Czolopicki refers to the battle of the Warsaw ghetto aa as "pogrom", a Yiddish word derived from the Russian meaning an organized massacre of Jews.

            As a psychologist, Boder was interested in Mr. Czolopicki's reactions to the pictures he showed him, a variation on the Rorschach test.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.

            The Polish uprising against the German occupiers of Warsaw began on August 1, 1944. It was led by the Polish Home Army, allied with the Polish government-in-exile in London. The Home Army was joined by the smaller People's Army, a leftist Polish resistance organization which included some Jews who had fought in the Warsaw Ghetto rebellion of April 19-May 16, 1943. The aim of the uprising was to seize the city of Warsaw before the approaching Red Army could conquer it. The unequal struggle ended on October 2, 1943 with the defeat of the insurgents.During the uprising some 150,000 civilians were killed including several thousand Jews who had been living in hiding in "Aryan" Warsaw after the collapse of the Warsaw Ghetto rebellion and some 16,000-20,000 Polish insurgents.

            The Rhineland is located in western Germany and is named for the Rhine river. After World War I, it was a buffer zone between Germany and the West with Allied troops occupying it from 1918-1930. It was then a demilitarized zone until occupied by Germany in 1936. Though this occupation was in defiance of the Versailles Treaty, there was no meaningful Allied response to it in keeping with the policy of appeasement at the time.

            With the collapse of the Polish uprising, the Germans expelled the bulk of the population of Warsaw to nearby detention camps and razed what was left of the city. About 100,000, including Mr. Czolopicki, were conscripted for forced labor, 65,000 were sent to concentration camps and the rest were deported  to the Generalgouvernement, the Polish administrative unit established by the Germans in October, 1939 and comprised of those parts of the country not incorporated into the Third Reich.

            Mr. Czolopiciki indicated earlier that he had begun studying at a school for design. It was for this school that he was paying. He then switched to the study of radio. There is no indication as to which organization was paying for his training in this area. It is possible that he was enrolled in an ORT training program.

            Was  Mr. Czolopicki living under an assumed name because he was Jewish or because as a non-Jewish able-bodied Polish male he feared deportation by the Germans for forced labor? The battle of the Warsaw Ghetto, the first urban uprising in German occupied Europe, was the longest of any Jewish uprising against the Germans.

            It is interesting that Mr. Czolopicki refers to the battle of the Warsaw ghetto aa as "pogrom", a Yiddish word derived from the Russian meaning an organized massacre of Jews.

            As a psychologist, Boder was interested in Mr. Czolopicki's reactions to the pictures he showed him, a variation on the Rorschach test.
