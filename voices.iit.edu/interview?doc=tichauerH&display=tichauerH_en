Civilian clothes were, of course, sufficiently available, because the baggage was taken away from all the women and the worst clothes selected and put at the disposal of the prisoners. But in order to distinguish us from the civilians at all [the general population], that is we did not have any contact with civilians at all, but should there have come one or another chance to escape, and in order to be able to distinguish us, it was ordered by Superior Storm Leader Ohmeier [?] that a black vertical stripe be drawn behind, on the back from top to bottom.

The going was to the right and left. And everything that went to the left went to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> 25. That time not only Jewish women went. A large part of those who went were Yugoslav women. Even state-German[Footnote 1: State-German—actual citizens of the German Reich as distinguished from <a class="term" href="#vothG_folk">Folk-German</a>, citizens of invaded countries who collaborated with Nazis and claimed privileges on account of alleged German ancestry.] women thieves' accomplices [?], state-German political prisoners, state-German asocial prisoners, Russian [women], everything that was still on hand. Indeed, no consideration was given whether Jewish or not Jewish. But it was then that the last <a class="term" href="#vothG_aryan">Aryan</a> was gas-killed [the last time that an <a class="term" href="#vothG_aryan">Aryan</a> was gas-killed]. Then further orders from <a class="placename" href="#vothL134">Berlin</a>, because the women supervisors or the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> people made 'special actions' only then when <a class="placename" href="#vothL134">Berlin</a> would order to proceed with a selection. I want to give a little example. There were about two thousand typhus cases in the hospital. The <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> inquired in <a class="placename" href="#vothL134">Berlin</a> whether it would be permitted to gas-kill the girls of the two thousand typhus cases, that is of the two thousand Jewish typhus cases. In about three months came the reply, 'Yes.' Meanwhile, however, forty per cent of these girls had gotten well. But the number two thousand had to be gathered up. So they took all Jewesses from the hospital who lay there, without exception, whether they had scabs or any other little thing. And so the rest which was missing from the two thousand, that is the rest who were discharged who were already well, was by . . . was replaced in a manner that they went through the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">blocks</a>. That is, the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> went through the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">blocks</a>. And this time, for example, they took a fancy to the barracks service detail who looked well. So they took the healthy barracks service detail. They took girls who at the moment were running on the road to the toilet. They took whatever got in their way. The number two thousand was reached. But that was not enough for them. They took this time advantage of the 'special action,' and raised the number to three thousand. And
                        these girls went all into the gas. I know that, because I marked their numbers in the number book with black according to a list which we received.</span>

He went as far as to provide enough water and soap, and such delousings took place every month.

And the pits which were installed in the year 1944 when again Hungarian transports were arriving, not [word not clear] transports were arriving, rendered a sight which does not yield to description, because one imagined himself in a living hell. One was encircled all round by fire. Our own <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> . . . at our <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> there was just wire fence, and thirty meters beyond was the crematory [number] two. And so it was not far. And one could see if he wanted to see. There were cases when one could see people stride in on automobiles or even on foot, and a few minutes later one saw naked corpses being carried out on litters from the bunkers. And what could one think about it [on such an instant]? One saw fire and smoke. One saw among the silhouette little figures, children—those must have been children—in pits. One saw only . . . one could . . . one can imagine how in the devil . . . [corrects herself] how in hell the devils treated their sacrifices [burned offerings].</span>

From . . . known from . . . from sources . . . from certain sources why actually Gypsies were brought to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>, from reliable sources, I may say the following. Hungary, the land which retained its Jews up to the year '44, had possibly no interest . . . well, it just did not hand over the Jews. And Germany did not know by what means to 'obtain' the Hungarian Jews. In the year '43, at the beginning of '43, I was told . . . I was told by a [woman] employee who worked close to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> leader that she has heard some whispers. That was Mrs. Wagener. That now Gypsies from Hungary will be brought in, not only Gypsies from Hungary, but Gypsies of all over Europe, in order to assemble them here, and afterwards to hand them over to Hungary, because in Hungary supposedly Gypsies are living in large numbers, but that in exchange Hungary should hand over to us [to Germany] the Jews. At that time that was rather unclear, because nobody knew about it. I myself had the opportunity . . . not only I. Then there were months when it was officially permitted to write home. I directed one card [post card] to a friend [woman] who had relatives in Hungary. Through the flower [through metaphoric, disguised wording], they understood that Hungarian Jews are to be expected. At the beginning of '43, that is, in the middle of '43, I had written about it, not officially, but of course through the flower.</span>

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
