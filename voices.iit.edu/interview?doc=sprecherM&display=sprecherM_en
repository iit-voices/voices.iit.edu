Part of the camp is located [?] in a form of barracks of the Hitler Youth. I am having a room here in one . . . I am having a room here in one, and the floors are [here] what they call in German parquet, fine [inlaid] hardwood floors. The illumination,, although the tension of the current is weak, is in very fine armatures [fixtures.] There is central heating. There was an interruption . . . A large field, practically a city of barracks and barracks and barracks all over. All are occupied by displaced Jews, but I see a number of temporary buildings, private buildings. I am also told that several hundred families are billeted in German homes. That is of course a rather interesting, rare situation, and the Germans are being forced to find decent location for people with [<a class="term" href="#vothG_dp">DPs</a>] families. These people are not fed by the camp. They have food ration cards and live on their money. What kind of money? — Well some [of them] managed to bring something [possibly post-armistice refugees from Poland, etc.] Some probably receive it from the States, and South America, and Africa. And the black market also helps.</span>

In the first [starting] row were lying a row of very young and well 'sportly' developed [physically strong] people. As soon as we heard the slightest motion in the vestibule, we instantly jumped back a half a meter.

It is not as easy to bear for a few hours . . . to bear tightly pressed one against the other, from various . . . through the various pressures from people who were lying in front, behind and on the sides. The pressure, and the wounds were so acute, that after the first or second day we all had bleeding wounds. The hand was torn and it was bleeding like from a water main. At that there also occurred cases when particularly privileged [?] <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> were looking for some special enjoyments. I shall describe one of them. There entered six inebriated <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a>. They had in their hands various pieces of wood, pieces of iron, and thick pieces of rubber hose. The title of the play was called that day 'blood bath.' A 'blood bath' consisted in the following: We had to line up in one row. Each <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> man was given a row which he was to 'belabor'. And he was beating over the face, over the eyes, over the nose, over the mouth until blood started flowing. When blood begins to flow a human grabs instinctively with his hand the bleeding wound, as if to stop the bleeding. In that moment would come the command: stand still. We were prohibited to move our hands, and the blood was flowing down to the ground. And in front of every person was formed a little puddle of blood. And so, since we were standing still, due to this standing the blood too stood still. So there came the command: 'motion', or, 'lie down.' Through the motion, and lying down with an open wound, the blood gushed, flowed again. When there was enough blood for each row, there came the command to lie down and to 'roll' in it with the face. Then we had to get up and all our faces were red from the blood. The <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> was satisfied and the program for that day was completed. [Pause].</span>

This was a linguistic designation in the concentration camp: 'completing' meant to torture until the man died. On the eighth day he had not a single healthy spot, not a single healthy centimeter on his body. It was all covered and swollen with blood. I still remember the last night. This pious person recited on the top of his voice the Vida [the prayer for those about to die] and the whole <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>, whether young or old, joined in the weeping and chanting. In the middle of the night the man had the fortune to die. He fell in a very deep stupor, and in the stupor he tore off all his clothes. And in the morning when we sat up he was lying dead, naked, and around him, like, just like during all the last days, was the blood-[soaked] red straw mattress [paillasse]. During the last few days we were laying that man, since the man had numerous open wounds, on the same straw mattress. On the same day it happened that just by accident the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> <a class="term" href="#vothG_fuehrer">fuehrer</a> passed through [the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>]. He never used to take an interest in our <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>, because his interest was limited to the daily report on the conditions and to the mortality report. The first greeting which was dealt out to us the first days in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, when we were aroused at three, three thirty in the morning was: 'How many dead are there today?' Not a 'Good morning', not a, 'Get up', only 'How many dead are there today?' And everyone who would ascertain that his neighbor was cold, reported: 'Here is one; here is one more.' And so he would compose his memo [?], his death-report, and with it he would run to the office. His interest in the run of the camp was satisfied for a while with it. And so, there was no interest on the part of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a>, of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> management, to ascertain how our <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> looks from the inside.

At the head of each detail stands a <a class="term" href="#vothG_capo">capo</a> [<a class="term" href="#vothG_trusty">trusty</a>] who leads his detail through the gate. At the gate sits the Jewish orchestra and plays. That was so ordered, established a few years back in the concentration camps in Austria, in Germany proper. Subsequently it was taken over by the concentration camps in the East at the borders between Germany and Poland, in Silesia, and, for example, in <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a> and the many sub-<a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lagers</a> near <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. All at once there came an order that the labor details which were about to leave the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> should step back. Each one back to his <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>. The reason was that a very large transport of Jewish prisoners [synonymous repetion] of Jewish prisoners had arrived from Hungary [Footnote: The deportation of the Jews from Hungary represents a special chaper, and is allegedly interwoven with the tragic fate of the Gypsies. There are also substantial repercussions at present (Summer 1955) in Israel connected with the Hungarian deportations. —D.P.B.] Since the transport was very large, they had to be led simultaneously to all five crematories. There arrived a hundred RR-cars, and each was packed with a hundred to a hundred and twenty prisoners. And so the whole road was a mass of moving, newly arrived Jews from Hungary, and [so] we had no room to get through to our work. Only after the Jewish prisoners from Hungary were led through on the way to the crematory were able to pass to work. And while these Jewish prisoners from Hungary marched to the crematory there was sitting in every <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> a prisoners' orchestra and played — played the tunes which the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> had selected. Many cheerful Viennese tunes, other tunes, at the wish of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> were played while the Jews were approaching step by step each one to his creamtory. [Pause]. There was a case. I was going one morning to the crematory two. Crematory one and two. There it was arranged that the gas chambers were underground. The crematories three and four were set so that the gas chambers were above ground. In both, in the four crematories were working hundreds of Jewish prisoners.</span>

                    Acronym for the German Schutzstaffel (“Protective Echelon”), a major Nazi organization. It grew from a small paramilitary unit to a powerful force that served as Hitler's "Praetorian Guard," the Nazi Party's "Shield Squadron" and a force that, fielding almost a million men (both on the front lines and as political police), managed to exert as much political influence as the German Army. Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
