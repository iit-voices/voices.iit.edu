    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "3.223","u": "[In English] August the . . . August the 20th, 1946. Paris. The interviewee is Mr. Olinsky [mispronounced by Boder], a high official in the American occupied . . . a high official in the Displaced People&#39;s camps and [is here] on the business of displaced people in the American occupied zone."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "26.439","u": "[In Yiddish] Mr. Oleiski, would you be so kind as to tell us where you are now and what your post is in reference to the Jewish refugees, or the Jewish persons in the American zone?"},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "46.431","u": "I am now, that means I live in Munich. In Munich I have a post as member of the Central Committee of the Liberated Jews in Germany; and I direct, as an elected member, the process of &#39;industrialization&#39; [incorporating into a productive life] and &#39;restratification&#39; of the Jews in Germany. At the same time, I have the mandate of the society of ORT UNION and I am the director of the Society ORT in the whole American zone."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "89.318","u": "Now tell me, does the American government permit such societies, such organizations?"},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "99.018","u": "The ORT society . . . the ORT society is a part of UNRRA, and the American Military Force aids with greatest sympathies the activities of the ORT. They [the Americans] find that the &#39;restratification&#39; . . . the reincorporation of the Jews into the process of industry, their requalification, and their preparation for a new life, to be one of the most important tasks to be achieved in the American zone. [NOTE: He uses for the second time the word Umschichtung, which would almost mean, &#39;reculturation&#39;. It means the return of the people from the level of social &#39;sub-strata&#39; or &#39;anti-strata&#39; to a level of social acceptability and dignity]. For this reason the work of the ORT is [in Hebrew] &#39;in the order of the day&#39;, so that all the liberated Jews may be incorporated again in the most important, normal process of work."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "147.758","u": "As a psychologist, I should like to know what are your greatest . . . greatest difficulties; with what kind of people among the refugees, the [ex] prisoners, do you have the greatest difficulties?"},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "167.618","u": "[A pause&#226;In a solemn tone] You must understand, and so the world in general must comprehend, that we were condemned to perish by labor. The largest part of the Jewish Kibbutz [meaning here, apparently, general working communities] . . . of the Jewish Kibbutzes in Eastern Europe were annihilated. Only a small part [of the Jews], the healthier ones, were led away to Germany to the concentration camps, and there they were compelled to work hard physically . . . the hardest physical labor; and the largest part has perished. And as a consequence, a certain &#39;complex&#39; has developed among the &#39;liberated Jews,&#39; a negative attitude towards work. And for us, the public workers, the responsible people who stand at the head of the Jewish commonwealth in Germany, it is the task to endeavor to extirpate this negative complex, to eradicate it from the soul of the Jewish person, and to enlighten him and tell [him], &#39;Times are different and conditions are different; and therefore, the attitude towards work must be entirely different.&#39; And that is the most important job which I am doing at the present. We endeavor, by various methods, to rehabilitate the Jewish person towards work. And by means of this we intend to liberate him from the dark past [?] and prepare him for a brighter and clearer future&#226;with faith in people, faith in life, and faith in himself, since this is the most important thing in achieving a healthy personality."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "282.677","u": "Now tell me, I have little hope that I will be able to enter the American Zone [This refers to my great difficulties in getting clearance for Germany, which later, however, was obtained]. Will you please describe, how do the Jews live and where do they live now in the American Zone? And I also want to know . . . Tell me this and then I have some other questions."},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "305.518","u": "The largest part of the Jews live in lagers in the American Zone. These lagers are former armories, or transient homes, and former factories which had many workers. A smaller part lives in [small] towns . . . in cities and towns. The dwellings of the people are not happy, not decent [citizen-like] and not pleasant. Several families are compelled to live in one large room; people are compelled to eat in large refectories, it is impossible to create that genial [way of] life which would . . . under which that great mournful past which the people have experienced could be forgotten."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "368.221","u": "Well . . . Go ahead . . . Now let me tell you, people who live in warmth and contentment . . . could possibly think that if they had survived &#39;the Germans&#39; they would be happy and satisfied with anything they got. How can you explain the fact that they are unhappy and dissatisfied? [It is understood that this question was asked for the benefit of a . . . &#39;hypothetical&#39; future reader] . . . That again is a psychological question."},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "407.402","u": "[A Pause. He continues in a solemn voice as if &#39;Once an orator, always an orator,&#39; or as if &#39;No opportunity should be missed to work for the cause, which in his case, has definitely absorbed his existence.&#39;] First of all [?], the heavy, bitter disappointment in the future. The Jews in Germany have believed and thought that first of all . . . first of all, attention would be directed towards those people who have gone through so much, and have lived through so much. And therefore, we thought that only a short time would pass and the possibility would be created that we would be able to depart for such a country, in a Jewish community, where we could lead a real life and could forget the &#39;climate&#39;, land, and people who brought over us so much suffering and misfortune. A Jew in Germany who moves about surrounded completely by Germans&#226;among Germans&#226;is unable to forget the grave experiences. Besides the Jews in Germany are compelled to look on and see that they who once lived a fine and citizenlike life, possessing everything; and then the Germans had everything taken away and have ruined everything that they possessed&#226;materially and spiritually . . . and these people [the Germans] live a normal life in beautiful apartments, apartments consisting of several rooms; they are able to have everything. And moreover, many, many of their criminals go around at liberty in disguise, and are being abetted by the German population. And still more, one does not see any spiritual transformation or change in the German people. We do not hear and we do not see that what we have expected, and that what we have observed in other people&#226;and especially among us Jews. When the Jewish people have ever committed any misdeeds against God or man, or nations, any social deed, any immoral deed, we had our people who stood up, . . . our prophets who shouted to the people and appealed to the conscience of the people, and would tell them that they had committed a crime and that the crime had to be atoned for.But one does not notice the like . . . one does not observe the like in the German people. And that, too, is one of the greatest disappointments, and that is one of the greatest outrages which plagues the Jewish person. And he asks . . . Who knows . . . ? Who knows whether or not in a very short time, this malicious, poisonous swine in the heart of Europe, will rise again and will gorge himself, gorge himself again&#226;to give humanity an encore of what he has planned before&#226;to bring death to all progress of mankind?"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "587.131","u": "Now, let us return to the concrete situation. You say people live in lagers. [A few words are said in whispers, apparently referring to the position of the microphone.] Are there complete Jewish families again? Are there married people with children? How do they live?"},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "614.039","u": "As we came out of the concentration camps there were among us neither children or old people. There were only people within the ages of eighteen to forty, to forty-five. Lonely [single] people, wretched people. Subsequently, a flow of people, partisans, who had lived in the forests came. And they had escaped from the ghettos with their families, and those were the first children and the first old people which we came about to see. Third, another flow of people came who, too, were in hiding under &#39;Aryan papers;&#39; were hidden in families, in better Christian families&#226;they came to us with their whole families. Also, very many marriages were consumated within that year; and today, there are daily many, many weddings. And so, as if nature is intending to make good for this great loss which occurred due to this greatest of Jewish catastrophes, we see very many births at present. Daily tenths of births. The Jewish person who had to live all that time in concentration camps, be it as a man, be it as a woman, separated; and suffering at present the mighty disappointment in not finding his family in [word not clear]; and everyone is endeavoring to achieve an intimate family life. And through this fact, many families are being founded, close families. And still there are conditions which impede the founding of numerous families, since it becomes necessary to live in single . . . that several families have to live in a single room. And that is one of the gravest of the . . . [he raises his voice] better to say, not only the gravest but the utmost unjust treatment of the gravely tortured people, that conditions cannot be brought about so that the mournful past could be forgotten. That would be greatly enhanced if we could create conditions under which Jewish families could live by themselves."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "767.009","u": "Now tell me, Mr. Oleiski [the name is mispronounced] . . . I am a sociologist, I am a psychologist. Let us imagine that there is a room of this size [the interview took place in an average size room in the Grand Hotel in Paris, about 12&#39; x 12&#39;, if I remember correctly] or a bit larger. How can several families live there? Describe it to me&#226;it is unbelievable."},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "787.620","u": "In a room in which several families have to live in is being placed a cupboard, or two wardrobes, and it [the room] is being subdivided in two or three parts, or a blanket, a comforter, or a bedsheet is hung up; and so one &#39;little&#39; family separates itself from the other &#39;little&#39; family. [The word &#39;little&#39; signifies here the diminutive form of the word &#39;family&#39;, It has the meaning both of endearment and compassion.] Of course, it is not good indeed, because at times quarrels occur. People want to achieve some coziness, not only in respect to their foodstuffs, which are tasteless or bad tasting; monotonous, as supplied by the enormous refectories . . . canned meat . . . People crave at times to prepare their own supper in a genial moment . . . and [the crowded living conditions] become badly disturbing and very unpleasant."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "839.196","u": "Now then . . . the UNRRA provides the food. How is it done..? There are large refectories . . . and then . . . ? Do people come three times a day for meals?"},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "851.725","u": "People come three times a day to the refectories to eat, and the food is being dealt out there. But in recent times it was accomplished through great efforts, because the UNRRA did not want to agree to its . . . They said: those who get . . . if the food should be given, the dry [unprepared] food [be given] to take home, it could be used for other purposes, or exchanged [traded]. But we provided to them that for families it is much more important that they get their dry supplies, that they themselves should fix their meals, and [be able] to prepare them the way the family knows how. And we have accomplished that, and though we get our supplies in the form of canned foods, a form from which it is very difficult to prepare a palatable meal which would make life more pleasant for the people . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "909.832","u": "Now let us take another topic. Besides . . . besides the training given by ORT, as reported [at the convention], what kind of cultural life do people have there?"},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "931.486","u": "When we observe the present way of life in the Jewish lagers, we must say, and we may say it with pride, that such a vitality has emerged again among the Jewish people; and we see a Jewish social and cultural life gushing in all little corners where Jewish . . . Jews live communities. Take the lagers                         Landsberg, Ferenwald [?], Feldafing. You have not only a trade school where hundreds of people learn a trade; you have not only an elementary school; you have not only a &#39;People&#39;s university,&#39; you also have there a kindergarten, you have a theatre, you have a choir; you have a great sports organization, sometimes one, sometimes two. You have a broadly ramified party life. All parties of the Jewish street [old-time Jewish sections of cities] and all varieties of Zionism. Hundreds of Kibbutzim [work communities]. You have everything that once existed in the Jewish towns, but with a much greater impetus, in a much broader shape. You have on top a Jewish committee chosen by democratic elections, responsible [?] for the whole social and cultural life; so that we can say with pride that the Jew has returned again . . . that in a social and cultural sense he has again risen to the heights. And those ethical principles which we have carried through generations are firmly ingrained into the soul of the Jew, and we see it return to full development and to full spiritual ascent, as we have seen it before."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1039.490","u": "Now tell me. IT is being said that there were &#39;good&#39; Germans, be it professors, be it doctors, be it artisans . . . There are now German socialists and the like . . . Is there any common life or intercourse between the Jews and the local German population?"},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1067.556","u": "There is no common life between the Jews and the local German population, and there never will be such. There remains for eternity a wall which will not disappear,&#226;a much greater wall than at one time between the Jews and Spain. If the Jews . . . if the Jews would still be living in the religious . . . in those religious sentiments, which they would . . . by which the Jews once lived in Spain . . . the curse which the Jews would put on Germany . . . the form of the curse and the scope [?] of the curse would be much sharper than the one evoked before . . . There is no contact and no business [?] between the Jewish . . . the real Jewish man. Sure, it may happen that a Jew from a lager may trade with a German for one object or another he may need, to obtain an indispensable object which he cannot find in the lager. But that is only an instant, a passing [episode], which does not signify any contact."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1141.680","u": "Are there no individual cases of that what we call &#39;fraternizing?&#39; Say that a Jew may marry a German . . . a German girl?"},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1152.773","u": "There are such incidents, and such incidents have happened. And at the last meeting of the Central Committee . . . at the last meeting, not of the Central Committee, at the last meeting of the Council, there were even considered such proposals, to call on the Jewish committees&#226;and the wish emanated not from religious people, but from people who are only nationally minded. People, Jews, representatives who declared that such people who could enter nowadays in intimate friendship with the Germans, must be ostracized [excommunicated] and excluded from the Jewish community. I do not see for the time being . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1205.411","u": "Hm . . ."},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1206.182","u": ". . . with the mood that prevails in Germany, and with the attitude and indifference of the German population even now towards our depredations . . . I do not see any possibility of any communication [?] between us Jews even with the progressives, even with those circles of population who have not participated in the Hitler regime."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1237.355","u": "Now tell me, what are the social relationships between the men and women of the American army and the former prisoners. How . . . did it happen that an American soldier has never [?] married a Jewish girl? [This question seems to have been pertinent in those days]."},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1270.118","u": "[Pause] It is possible that individual cases have occured of American soldiers who got together with Jewish girls. I know very little about it. I know that Jewish soldiers from America have formed friendships with Jewish girls."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1292.475","u": "They did?"},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1293.269","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1293.864","u": "Yes.."},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1294.126","u": "Jewish soldiers, or Jewish officers. But in general, as to Americans [apparently Christians], I have not heard. You must know that we live altogether isolated in the lagers or in the cities, and the ordinary [?] Jewish girl and the ordinary [?] Jewish boy have longed one for the other. And in entering in a friendship they also longed for the Jewish community life [??], from which they were torn away. And that is why the weddings take place mainly in the lagers, and mainly between a . . . between Jewish boys and girls. It is possible that the language, it is possible that more serious relationships, it is possible that these [factors] impeded the instances of contact between the American soldiers and the Jewish . . . the Jewish women."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1368.729","u": "Tell me, if people live in a lager are they able to go around freely through the cities? May one go around freely, travel somewhere?"},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1377.756","u": "Yes. One may travel, one may travel back and forth, one may freely move through the cities. It was only at the beginning that people had to have passes in order to leave the lager. But now one may travel everywhere in the American Zone&#226;one may move freely. But to transfer from one lager to another, to remain, to live there, to freely change from one lager to another is not possible, because one may loose his food allotment and the other lager would not accept him. The lagers are mostly closed, and for new people it is very, very difficult. only when it pertains to a very important and useful person."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1418.883","u": "Yes.."},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1419.201","u": "Skilled workers or cultural workers, or a person needed for an important public office&#226;only for such people can one prevail upon the director that he permit acceptance [of him] into the lager."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1435.953","u": "Do you have any entertainment in the lager? [In English] &#39;motion pictures;&#39; I mean cinemas, concerts, theaters . . ."},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1447.034","u": "I have told you that there is an extensive cultural life in the lagers. We started immediately to do a great deal in that field. The Jew longed a great deal for it. All the [cultural] arrangements in the lagers are of the kind that existed before [in the olden times] and they are being taken by storm. One cannot take in so many people. We have cafes, we have a kino, we have our own theater . . ."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1476.498","u": "What do you mean, you have cafes. People go there and pay for . . ."},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1479.656","u": "Yes . . . [?]"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1480.309","u": "Yes? Now then . . ."},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1481.667","u": "Before the cafes were completely free. We gave to the working man . . . We wanted to attract . . . attract the Jews to work, so we distributed free passes [?] to the kino, free passes for the caf, free passes for the theater."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1497.171","u": "What . . . [request for explanation of the term used for the word &#39;passes&#39;]"},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1498.451","u": "Passes for the kino&#226;one [otherwise] could not go to the kino &#39;for free,&#39; to the theater, to the cafe . . . It was all figured out. He had a booklet [registering] where he could go. Once a week to the kino, once to the theater, once to the cafe. Now we have introduced a small fee. Everyone may go to the cafe, he may dance, he can pass the time. And so in the lagers there are facilities to pass the evenings."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1533.162","u": "Besides . . . Go on."},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1534.258","u": "Besides, we have arranged the first concerts. We have our own cafe orchestra, a concert [?] orchestra with Rausch [?], with Hofmeckler [?], who still played in the Kovno ghetto. We have another orchestra, of former concentration camp prisoners, and this . . . and this orchestra performs more serious music, symphonic music. They travel from lager to lager; and that is a great . . . is of great cultural significance for the jew."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1568.030","u": "Tell me this. You say they pay . . . What kind of money does the person have who lives in a lager?"},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1579.280","u": "[Pause] We have the same money as the Germans."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1583.494","u": "Who gives it to you?"},    {"who": "Jacob Oleiski", "start": "1585.001","u": "The money that we have [we possess] for various reasons. First, the officials of the Magistrate, of the Jewish Magistrate who work in the field of social welfare or in other fields, even in the shops, our own productive shops, receive a monthly salary of various amounts, five hundred, six hundred, seven hundred, three hundred, four hundred marks per month.

We were taken to Stutow, which was the most dangerous concentration camp of all Eastern Europe. From East Prussia . . . from &#39;oriental&#39; Prussia.

For example, in Lithuania the Gypsies remained free&#226;nothing was done to them. When we . . . when they would lead us to hard work, heavily guarded by the SS, to the airport; and we had no right to go on the sidewalk&#226;we had to walk in the street, heavily guarded . . . We would see the Gypsies then walking on the sidewalks, moving around freely. In Lithuania the Gypsies were not molested."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2107.332","u": "Now then, Mr. Oleiski, you have to go to the convention [of the ORT then in session in Paris] and we also have to get something to eat.

The largest part of the Jewish Kibbutz [meaning here, apparently, general working communities] . . . of the Jewish Kibbutzes in Eastern Europe were annihilated. Only a small part [of the Jews], the healthier ones, were led away to Germany to the concentration camps, and there they were compelled to work hard physically . . . the hardest physical labor; and the largest part has perished. And as a consequence, a certain &#39;complex&#39; has developed among the &#39;liberated Jews,&#39; a negative attitude towards work. And for us, the public workers, the responsible people who stand at the head of the Jewish commonwealth in Germany, it is the task to endeavor to extirpate this negative complex, to eradicate it from the soul of the Jewish person, and to enlighten him and tell [him], &#39;Times are different and conditions are different; and therefore, the attitude towards work must be entirely different.&#39; And that is the most important job which I am doing at the present.

The Jews in Germany have believed and thought that first of all . . . first of all, attention would be directed towards those people who have gone through so much, and have lived through so much. And therefore, we thought that only a short time would pass and the possibility would be created that we would be able to depart for such a country, in a Jewish community, where we could lead a real life and could forget the &#39;climate&#39;, land, and people who brought over us so much suffering and misfortune. A Jew in Germany who moves about surrounded completely by Germans&#226;among Germans&#226;is unable to forget the grave experiences. Besides the Jews in Germany are compelled to look on and see that they who once lived a fine and citizenlike life, possessing everything; and then the Germans had everything taken away and have ruined everything that they possessed&#226;materially and spiritually . . . and these people [the Germans] live a normal life in beautiful apartments, apartments consisting of several rooms; they are able to have everything. And moreover, many, many of their criminals go around at liberty in disguise, and are being abetted by the German population. And still more, one does not see any spiritual transformation or change in the German people. We do not hear and we do not see that what we have expected, and that what we have observed in other people&#226;and especially among us Jews. When the Jewish people have ever committed any misdeeds against God or man, or nations, any social deed, any immoral deed, we had our people who stood up, . . . our prophets who shouted to the people and appealed to the conscience of the people, and would tell them that they had committed a crime and that the crime had to be atoned for.But one does not notice the like . . . one does not observe the like in the German people. And that, too, is one of the greatest disappointments, and that is one of the greatest outrages which plagues the Jewish person. And he asks . . . Who knows . . . ? Who knows whether or not in a very short time, this malicious, poisonous swine in the heart of Europe, will rise again and will gorge himself, gorge himself again&#226;to give humanity an encore of what he has planned before&#226;to bring death to all progress of mankind?</p>

And they had escaped from the ghettos with their families, and those were the first children and the first old people which we came about to see. Third, another flow of people came who, too, were in hiding under &#39;Aryan papers;&#39; were hidden in families, in better Christian families&#226;they came to us with their whole families. Also, very many marriages were consumated within that year; and today, there are daily many, many weddings.

                    <p class="utterance">No. Only that I was told by other Jewish refugees [correcting] inmates in our Dachau                         lager that there was in Auschwitz also a lager, were barracks in which were congregated the Gypsies.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">The Gypsies were rounded up in Germany and in other countries. And these gypsies were occupied there . . . from the beginning they were treated well . . . and they even were used as capos [trustys] and for various other more privileged posts.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">I was told this by comrades, by friends who were together with me in the Dachau                         lager, who previously [?] were in Auschwitz.</p>
                                                                                                <b>David Boder</b>
                    <p class="utterance">What is the estimate? How many thousands of them were there that a gypsy question could have emerged?</p>

                    <p class="utterance">That is hard for me to tell; it is unknown to me.</p>
                                                                                                <b>David Boder</b>
                    <p class="utterance">Are they estimated in the thousands?</p>

                    <p class="utterance">Possibly only in the thousands. For example, in Lithuania the Gypsies remained free&#226;nothing was done to them. When we . . . when they would lead us to hard work, heavily guarded by the SS, to the airport; and we had no right to go on the sidewalk&#226;we had to walk in the street, heavily guarded . . . We would see the Gypsies then walking on the sidewalks, moving around freely. In Lithuania the Gypsies were not molested.</p>
                                                                                                <b>David Boder</b>
                    <p class="utterance">Now then, Mr. Oleiski, you have to go to the convention [of the ORT then in session in Paris] and we also have to get something to eat. So for today we shall have to conclude. If you think you have some other things to tell, we shall get together yet again. I would be very grateful if you would grant me &#39;another spool&#39; of interview.</p>
