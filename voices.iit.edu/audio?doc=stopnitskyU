At that time it wasn&#39;t yet known for what purpose the Jews were sent away. It was said that the Jews are being re-settled to other districts where they could continue to live.

At that time transports of two thousand, three thousand Jews would arrive. Arriving at Auschwitz they were told that they proceed traveling to a place of work. They were told to take off all their clothes to get ready to go bathing. Each one was given a towel with a little piece of soap as is usually done when people go into a bathhouse. On the [door] leading to the gas chamber was a sign in German &#34;bathhouse&#34;. The people simply marched in and there occurred the gas-killing. Sometimes it would last fifteen minutes, five, minutes, sometimes an hour, sometimes two hours. This depended on the experimentation with various gases which were manufactured by the I. G.

At that time it wasn&#39;t yet known for what purpose the Jews were sent away. It was said that the Jews are being re-settled to other districts where they could continue to live.

From then on it was &#34;obscurely felt&#34; that the Jews are not being re-settled but they are taken to be murdered. But to murder them openly, they still could not decide. But in time they record a case when a woman, a woman from Bedzin has managed to escape&#226;in what way is not exactly known&#226;but she escaped from that hell, and she reported exactly how things occurred there at the time. At that time transports of two thousand, three thousand Jews would arrive. Arriving at Auschwitz they were told that they proceed traveling to a place of work. They were told to take off all their clothes to get ready to go bathing. Each one was given a towel with a little piece of soap as is usually done when people go into a bathhouse. On the [door] leading to the gas chamber was a sign in German &#34;bathhouse&#34;. The people simply marched in and there occurred the gas-killing. Sometimes it would last fifteen minutes, five, minutes, sometimes an hour, sometimes two hours. This depended on the experimentation with various gases which were manufactured by the I. G. Farben Industries in Auschwitz. Because there in the lager [camp]&#226;the lager occupied 40 kilometers square&#226;and in this lager was a gigantic plant of that great world wide concern, the I. G.

In about two hours there arrived the Gestapo, all the civilians [deputies] with their dogs. They held clubs in their hands and started driving the crowd into formation, four in a row, and we marched away to the railroad station. That wasn&#39;t very far, a ten minute walk. When we arrived at the railroad station, we had to wait for one hour, and then arrived thirty cattle cars, cars in which cattle are being transported, animals. [The cattle cars in Europe are not like the American stock cars with provisions for plenty of ventilation; they are simply solidly closed freight cars with possibly a small window near the ceiling. In most cases these were the old type freight cars on four wheels which had the inscription, &#34;Forty men or eight horses.&#34; But normally when people such as soldiers or railroad working men were transported in such cars, they were provided with plank beds and the doors were kept open for ventilation.] There were no facilities to get in into these cars, but in the cars that were standing at the railroad platform [the train was apparently longer than the small platform of the little town] at the railroad station, in these [cars] entered a hundred sixty people into each car.</p>

And so when we embarked into the trains, into the cars, we felt that we were extra-ordinarily crowded together. The cars were shut, hermetically shut, without any opening for air. Soon the atmosphere became extraordinarily suffocating, people started to strip themselves naked, we soon noticed how old people, gasping for air, became suffocated in the cars. I must remark that we didn&#39;t travel more than three hours we made stops at various stations and the train had no clearance to proceed ahead one must remember that the whole distance was about thirty kilometers between Bedzin and Auschwitz, you understand how it is?</p>

Whether they were brought from other lagers in Poland that were vacated, because up to this time there were lagers in Poland that had no crematories, work lagers.

After having gone through such misfortunes, it is obvious that it has no sense to remain in the goles, and of sheer resignation after these misfortunes, I arrived here in H&#195;nonville in order to get by any means, be it legal or illegal, notwithstanding any obstacles or deterrents. [I am not sure of the last two words], just to reach the land of Israel. Because to end one&#39;s days as a human being, and to live how one should, is possible only in the land of Israel. Even to die we have seen already that the goles [exile from the Holy Land] may give us some twenty good years again [I am not sure of the translation], but afterwards . . . it does not give us any point of assurance against further extermination, massacres. It has no sense to remain further in exile because it may lead to [a situation] that the million and a half Jews which have survived&#226;beware and beware again&#226;will be submitted to the same [fate] as those before. We felt safe in Poland also, we also did not see the danger, and we had much to regret that we didn&#39;t work for the land of Israel. But now we must apply all strengths, all possible means, even illegal means; there even was a case when we were asked whether we would go there by way of Cyprus.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">[In Yiddish] Well, I thank you very much, Mr. Stopnitsky. It was a very good report. I have hard a lot of stories and, nevertheless, you have told me some things new. One constantly hears new things. It is never enough.</p>
                                                                                                <b>Udel Stopnitsky</b>
                    <p class="utterance">If you should listen for months, for months at a stretch you will not hear everything that the Polish Jews went through. It is very much but let it be enough because all the Polish Jews have contributed to the tradgedy.</p>
