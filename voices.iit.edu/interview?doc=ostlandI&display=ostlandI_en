Could it be that for him personally the highpoint of German violence came with the deportation so vividly described in "Bechuckotay," It suffices to quote only one verse from "Takhakho Bechuckotay" which expresses by no means the most extreme of the depredations that were to come over the Children of Israel if they should fail to observe the teachings of the Torah: "And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities; and I will send the Pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy." (Leviticus XXVI: 25) In general "Takhakho Ki Tahbo" lists the "mortal sins" while "Takhakho Bechuckotay" gives the most detailed aspects of punishment by catastrophe. Both the tendency to suppress even the thought of such sings referring in large measure to sex perversions on the one hand, while on the other hand the memories of the German inhumanities did not cease to haunt them, may also account for this repeated substitution of "Bechuckotay" for "Ki Tahbo." No wonder that Rabbi Ostland, as well as his father-in-law, Rabbi Bloch, as so many pious Jews, were struck by the vivid resemblance between the castastrophe brought upon them by the Germans who evoked into reality above any measure, most of the macabre prophecies of the "Takhakho Bechuckotay."] is being read.</span>

This one [the fence] was broken through in several places and there were dug for military purposes trenches and it was desecrated very badly.

All our efforts to fence it in again, and to throw out all the extraneous rubble which the former armies left there were for the time being, in vain, and the cemetery still remained in a terrible, regretable state.</span>

Like in those times there still take place maneuvers, military maneuvers and the destruction continues [I am not sure of the last few words]. Now about the other things. When afterwards the congregation began to grow in <a class="placename" href="#vothL74">Vilna</a> when the number of Jews increased, it became too crowded in number 19 German Street and it was decided to move to Zavalnya Street 35 to the Choral Synagogue. There we found two rooms adjoining the Choral Synagogue. There we established the congregation and after Rabbi Gutman left the town when he departed for Poland, we took over the rabbinate; also the shohets changed [in membership and personnel]. The parish developed rather well. It devoted itself to social service and it distributed during the course of the one summer '45- [the congregation] distributed up to 100,000 rubles for the poor, for those who returned from <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lagers</a>, for strangers who arrived. The parish also devoted itself with the reestablishment of Jewish life [I am not sure of the translation]. They established a wide correspondence for the communication from friend to friend and other important work. At the end of '45 there were in <a class="placename" href="#vothL74">Vilna</a> already nearly 17,000 Jews. But unfortunately, there was no need in <a class="placename" href="#vothL74">Vilna</a> for more than one single house of prayer. There could be no more than one single assembly for prayer in the whole city of <a class="placename" href="#vothL74">Vilna</a>.</span>

            Remark of the investigator made at the moment of translation in 1950: I suspect that this is an assumed name. The so-called infiltrees, that is the individuals who were running away from Lithuania and Poland or other regions which we are accustomed now to call the "iron curtain" states were behaving rather cautiously. They would not give their right names and not tell too much about how they managed to arrive in France, or for that matter in Switzerland or Italy.

                Following the German occupation of this Lithuanian city in June 1941 (which was one-quarter Jewish in 1939), 1000 Jews were shot within the first weeks, after which two ghetto areas were established (in the Kaukas and Traku areas). Only 500 area Jews survived until liberation in 1944.

            Remark of the investigator made at the moment of translation in 1950: I suspect that this is an assumed name. The so-called infiltrees, that is the individuals who were running away from Lithuania and Poland or other regions which we are accustomed now to call the "iron curtain" states were behaving rather cautiously. They would not give their right names and not tell too much about how they managed to arrive in France, or for that matter in Switzerland or Italy.
