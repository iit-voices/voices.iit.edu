There were perhaps, who knows, thirty people altogether in that house where we were, in one room. And they entered. I was sleeping there with two little girls. These children had also escaped from the Radzin <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">Ghetto</a>. Two girls, little ones. One was about eight years old, and one about six years. I was sleeping with them in the room. There were other girls. In our room there were about fifteen persons. In the middle of the night we hear...there lived a woodcutter [?], so we thought that someone is chopping wood. We jump up. We hear shooting. They began shooting. We lay in great deathly fear. And they were knocking on our door. And I did not know why they could not enter through the door. I the morning I got up. I opened the door. A shot person fell into...into my room, itno the house where we were lying. When we came in [into the other rooms] there lay shot all who were living in those rooms. Two children with a father who were sleeping in bed, everything was shot. A man lay with his stomach completely torn open, his guts outside on the ground. And later Jewish police came in. The Germans had left, and we had to clean up the blood and all that. There was lying the bedding and the shot. All that we had to clean up. There were also two men who had been in a <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. At that time there were <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>.. It was in Oswoboj.</span>

We had to relieve ourselves on the same place where we slept. I was there a whole night. I saw it was bad. I did not want to go to death. I went on fighting against it. I went over to a window.

There you will be.' She says, 'Yes, a children's home! You see, there is the crematory. It burns. There they will burn me.' It was very painful for me. I could not stand it. I could not sleep. But suddenly the child fell asleep in my arms. I left the child lying on the ground and went over to some man who worked there in the shower-bath, and I pleaded with him. I lied to him. I said it was my sister's child, and he should see to help me save the child. So he said, 'You know what? Tomorrow morning you will all be undressed nude, and you will all be led before the doctor. He will make such a selection. And the child, 'he says,' you will tell to hide in the your [rags] when you will undress.' And that child was very clever. She did not even take off the shoes. She hid. And she hid in the rags. And I was waiting thus--it was in the morning--till the evening, till the child will come out. And in the evening I saw the child all dressed up. </span>

Why do we deserve it? But it was not so. For him it was death. And we, for us, indeed, came the time that we were liberated, but it still took a long time yet. It took another month. After being there for perhaps two months there came another order. There had begun strong air-raids. We ran...every night we were led into a forest to a bunker. They said we have to run away. They were afraid for themselves. They did not take us so that we should be saved, but they wanted to save themselves, and they did not want to leave us alone, because they were afraid we will escape. And they dragged us. We were working night shift. Snow was falling. Three, four times a night they called alarm, and we had to get out and run to the forest, to the trench [?] They had made such a pit, and there to hide. We suffered like that for a few weeks.

It grew from a small paramilitary unit to a powerful force that served as Hitler's "Praetorian Guard," the Nazi Party's "Shield Squadron" and a force that, fielding almost a million men (both on the front lines and as political police), managed to exert as much political influence as the German Army. Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
