Afterwards three people were selected among us, they were not told why they would be taken where they would be taken, and they did not return. We heard that they were used for burning the people and then were shot themselves. In any case they did not return into the camp. After a few weeks, well it was already two months of our stay in <a class="placename" href="#vothC108" type="camp">Szebnie</a>, we were summoned to the place where they had the roll calls.

We suspected that something bad was going on. I comforted my son. And, um, after a few hours we heard that only the most important craftsmen, um, who were still needed in the camp, will be left behind, and, um, when their names were read out, I heard to my astonishment that my and my son's names were read as two painters who had employment in the camp.

We were 120, among them eight painters, and among the painters were my son and I.

There we were first taken to disinfection, to disinfection all the others went as well, 120 all in all, and at this disinfection we had to get our clothes from these gas chambers ourselves. The result of this was that a person was, um, gassed there, by accident, because he stood too long in this chamber, and died in the course of events, before his father's eyes, who was an upholsterer. In this camp <a class="placename" href="#vothC108" type="camp">Szebnie</a> we, my son and I, worked as painters for ten months. At that time we had, we were completely secluded from the world, this was an exclusively Jewish camp, and nearby was the Polish camp. We never fell together, only once a week, when we were to bathe, did we go over there into the Polish camp under strict surveillance, and after the bath we were led back into our shacks.

I was never there; I never got in contact with it. I only know this from telling. But I saw the bunker from afar and I know that the person did not come back. They even showed him from afar, the stretcher on which he was carried, the body of this deceased Unger. In July 44, I think this was because of the, um, war events outside, the camp was liquidated. We were put into rail cars, 80 to 100 people each in a rail car, and locked the cars so that we could not breathe. We had no water, no air, and the windows were, um, of these cattle cars, in which we had been led, with boards, um, nailed shut. Some tried to make holes in the wall or the floor of these rail cars in order to get air. Many passed out on the way, and in some places, right behind the station, um, stations, for some moments the doors of the rail cars were opened so that people could empty their bowels. Then we were put into the rail cars again, and again we go. After two days we came to a station, we did not know it was <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. When we were there, one of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> guards who led us told us, you will learn in a few minutes what happens to you. We were certain back then that we are in <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>, and someone called to us outside, we do not know who that is, you are already near the chimneys. We are in fact, the rail car in which we were, we do not know where we are, it drove onto this track that led to the chimneys. Panic broke out among us. It was, we were so hot that one could suffocate. Everyone undressed, because it was impossible to bear, it was in July. We lay there at night, many passed out, among them my son, because he did not recognize me at that time. He was told, your father is still alive, he said, no, that is not my father, he did not see in the darkness and he did not even recognize me by my voice. I addressed him, and he lay there like a dead body. Well, we all shouted, mass murderers, because we knew that we would experience death in a few minutes, and, about which we had been told many times. So we stood on this track all night, and only heard negotiations. When the door of the rail car was opened, they let us deboard. At that time we were beaten, why were we naked. This was already below this hall, where one entered to be burned...</span>

Some nights we spent in, um, in, not in, in barns, yes. Well, but that was not that we should not spend the night outside, but only because that we could not run away. And so we were shut up in different barns. They rounded us up, hundreds of people from various regions, not only our camp, but also other camps met there. Sometimes we were a couple thousand people in one barn. It was so spurious and there were fights, because every one of us had to fight for his place for the night with his comrades.</span>

Some begged the guards to shot them, because they couldn't bring themselves any further. With some it happened the way that, if they only stayed behind a little bit, one, um, said that he was suspected of an attempted flight and he was shot for that reason. Before us other camps had passed by and they had marked the way with various corpses. So that when we went along these roads, we, um, saw a lot of corpses in this striped clothing. These were all Jews, exclusively Jews, because only the Jews were marching. We... in this way we reached the camp <placeName type="camp" ref="#vothC39">Groß-Rosen</a>. In <placeName type="camp" ref="#vothC39">Groß-Rosen</a> they placed, they put us in a barrack, which hadn't been completed yet. It was all during the winter. To get to this barrack we had to take a path, which was so done, that the ground came up until over our knees, but seriously up to our knees. We could not get our feet out of this dirt. Then during the night, when we had already reached the barrack, we fell in ground and lay there until morning. The next morning they drove us out of the barrack and at a square there we got, um, we got food, well soup and some bread and a piece of a sausage for the way.</span>

They hurt a lot and it bled, I was afraid to take of my shoes, the wooden shoes, because I knew that something was wrong. I could not help my son and so I went on and it hurt a lot. Sometimes I trampled on the spot, sometimes so fast, ... when we stopped ... that my foot... well, when it was frozen, I couldn't feel the pain that much, the pain was eased. And then I did march well for some time until it defroze, then it started to hurt. I began to march poorly and my son was dragging me all the time. I always heard his words: Daddy, come daddy, come, because they are already watching you. You are always staying behind. He was afraid that when I stayed behind, I would be shot immediately. They put us in wagons in open wagons, in the train station of <placeName type="camp" ref="#vothC39">Groß-Rosen</a>.

Only then did we assure ourselves that at least one fourth had remained in the wagon. These were full of corpses. But three fourths still got off.

Some of us were selected as Chargen, as so called Buxen-eldest. [Translator's Note: With "Chargen" Frim is referring to a group of prisoners who were in charge in the barracks, which he calls Buchse/Buxe instead. An alternative term for Frim for those prisoners is Buxen-eldest. The term "Buxe" (Buchse?) itself is not a real German word yet can be found in German and Austrian Corps/Burschenschaften (fraternities)]. Every Buxe held twenty or thirty people. One of us was selected as Buxen-eldest, elected as Buxen-eldest. But they behaved in a ways, just as the <a class="term" href="#vothG_capo">Capos</a>. One Buxeneldest, he was Czech, I think, then.

We had no air during the nights, when one wanted to get up, there was hardly a possibility to do so without getting in a fight with your neighbors.

                    Derived from a Sanskrit word meaning “noble,” the term was used in Nazi pseudo-scientific jargon to denote a race which had supposedly superior blood and culture. During the Holocaust, “Aryan” came to mean anyone who was not Jewish or Roma (Gypsy).
