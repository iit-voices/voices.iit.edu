And so we had rested up for a time, and then we went to work. The work was not so hard. The work consisted only of a few bricks . . . to carry bricks, because they were building, the Germans were building there various bunkers and so forth. Kitchens they were building. And so it went on till the bombing. That means for the bombing there arrived . . . one . . . one day there arrived Anglo-American aircraft, and they bombed. That means they were probably so well informed, the Germans . . . eh . . . eh . . . the English aircraft, that they did not bomb the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> but they bombed everything round and round the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>.

                By November 24, 1941 the heart of Theresienstadt was turned into a walled ghetto. To the outside it was presented by the Nazis as a model Jewish settlement, but in reality it was a concentration camp. Theresienstadt was also used as a transit camp for European Jews en route to Auschwitz.
