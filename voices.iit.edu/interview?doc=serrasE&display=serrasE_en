                    Acronym for the German Schutzstaffel (“Protective Echelon”), a major Nazi organization. It grew from a small paramilitary unit to a powerful force that served as Hitler's "Praetorian Guard," the Nazi Party's "Shield Squadron" and a force that, fielding almost a million men (both on the front lines and as political police), managed to exert as much political influence as the German Army. Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
