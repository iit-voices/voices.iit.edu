I saw that they were taking all the men, the Jewish ones in the oldest district of <a class="placename" href="#vothL13">Paris</a>. That really was the second time [the second raid] because already a year ago they were taking people from <a class="placename" href="#vothC88" type="camp">Pithiviers</a>. And then the life started in our home like in so many Jewish homes--one was already missing. In time we got word about happenings in <a class="placename" href="#vothC27" type="camp">Drancy</a>. People yelled because they have no food. They have nothing to sleep on. It is dirty, and many people die from diarrhea and dysentery.

I found out that the police had come at night, and they said that they were going up to the second floor to another Jewish tenant, and so my father and mother and brother got out of the house and disappeared in the night. They got away and came to acquaintances who were French, Jewish-French; and there they hid because in those times they did not take yet French Jews. I found out about it, and I came to them. And the scene at the moment shall also not be described. One can't imagine it.

Sport clubs managed to get together. At school they also had talks among themselves. In my group we made a Jewish section, because Jews had other methods of action. They could not move around freely, and at first could not do the same things as the others, because to supply them with false identification papers was not a matter of one day. So it was a section of the Resistance. It wasn't the business of one day to manage the papers. So we had to find a place to live till the false papers were arranged, and that was not easy. In a few months, in three months, we started working with the French cells. Just like the French. A number of us became French <a class="term" href="#vothG_partisans">Partisans</a>. <a class="term" href="#vothG_partisans">Partisans</a> you have heard about. Many of us worked in propaganda. Others of us worked in solidarity units, that is, to help the mothers who had remained with children. And many of us were arrested in a short time but that could not scare us; we went on with our work. It is understood that in spite of the fact that we were in the Resistance, we had different viewpoints. The groups originated not only in sport groups, but also there were various political groups. I belonged to the Communist youth.<note n="11"><span class="note">The French communist resistance movement was energized by the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June 21, 1941 and the abrogation of the Stalin-Hitler Pact. Although Henja was at first in a specifically Jewish section of the communist resistance (which contained a number of Polish-born Jews), she indicates that her section later merged with the general communist resistance movement. The acronym for the military branch of the communist resistance was FTP-MOI.</span><sup><a href="#note_11">11</a></sup></note></span>

Not for them, but against them, he had to take his position. That is what I told my father. My parents were already old, about fifty-six, and of course they could not share my views. They feared for their daughter and they thought that if she would live with them she would be at home and could be protected by a [work] certificate. She would be able to leave the terrible conditions, so to speak, in which we all found ourselves. I couldn't say that my father worked for the Germans. No. He did not work for them. Through his connections he got a certificate. My brother was working, like many young people, in a factory which previously was a factory of fur jackets. But the difference was that [now] the fur jackets were going to Germany, whether we cared to know or not. That was the situation. I did not return home and so I got torn away from my parents. In the nine months, the time I was separated from my parents, I was only coming to see them from time to time, because it was impossible to visit them often. The police on the streets were very strict. They questioned one for his papers.</span>

One did not need, for them, a very smart yarn. I asked the inspectors permission--excuse me, but I have to recollect the events. But I want to show you how far the French inspectors were already educated--one really can't say even educated, because they had not time to get educated. They were already corrupt. I asked his permission to go to the toilet. So one of the inspectors led me all the way to the toilet, and he did not close the door. He followed me every step and spoke ugly words. For the first time in my life my feminine dignity was attacked. I could not imagine that there are in the world such men. They took me to the station. I took with me the things I could carry--my winter clothes, because I understood that I was to be deported, too. From the station I was taken to the bureau, and there were hundreds of inspectors.

And so they left me alone. I slept alone in a room in the secret division, as they called it, with six policemen in the room, on the table with no blanket, no nothing, no food, although I had no desire to eat. Through an inspector, who was--I felt that he was not an enemy, I sent a letter to my parents. There again my instinct was sound. He came to my parents and gave them the letter. And in the letter I wrote to my parents that [I said] I hadn't seen them for two years in case the police came to question them, they should find out that we hadn't seen each other for a long time.

They didn't tell about the women who were beaten naked, and who were starved. They didn't talk about them. Women, mothers of children, worked in the Resistance. Women from the Communist party, indeed in large numbers, Communist or not, they worked against the Germans. And that is what counts. The faces were unrecognizable, from the beatings of the Germans.

They didn't make a political issue of us. They did not make of our case a question of the Resistance. They made of our case a Jewish question.

Before coming to Drancy he had helped deport Jews from Vienna, Moravia and Greece. Once installed at Drancy, Brunner removed the Vichy-appointed camp commander and ran it with the help of SS officers. His rule was characterized by a marked deterioration of conditions for the inmates and concerted efforts to deport imprisoned Jews to Auschwitz. After the war Brunner disappeared. He was not tried at Nuremberg, but was tried in absentia in Paris in 1954 and sentenced to death. However, he was eventually granted asylum in Syria and lived there for many years under an assumed name. Brunner was never brought to justice.</span><sup><a href="#note_18">18</a></sup></note> [Footnote: One cannot help observing that the first half of the story of Brenner was told in a rather hesitant and phlegmatic way. One cannot really be sure whether she is informed of the facts or not. Or is it, as in so many cases of <a class="term" href="#vothG_dp">DPs</a>, that she really does not want to talk about the Germans and whatever happened to them? Only in the second part, when she begins, 'and there was a reason for' she becomes animated and persuasive.] [After a pause] He came, and they prepared lists. Each one was questioned. They did not say for what purpose. They were very insistent in asking whether we still had families in France, and where these families were, but we were not so foolish as to tell about our families. He simply said, 'Where is your family, so that we can send you away together.'<note n="19"><span class="note">This feigned solicitousness towards the victims was typical of Nazi deception. Later Henja recounts how upon the arrival of her transport at Auschwitz, the SS asked those who were old or weak to board trucks which would take them into the camp so they wouldn't have to walk. The trucks went straight to the gas chambers. It is unclear who the "he" to whom Henja refers might be.</span><sup><a href="#note_19">19</a></sup></note></span>

It will not be easy for me, indeed, as all of us say when we are asked to tell. To tell! That is the hardest thing for us. Why? Because there are no words.

I was almost two years in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. I was fortunate enough not to be evacuated like the others on the roads, where so many have died, after two years of life in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. We were lined up five abreast, men on the one side, women on the other side. German officers, with a stick in hand, with savage outcries which were for us still new, started dividing us up, one to the right, one to the left, whichever way it would occur to them. 'Leave your bundles here; you will return presently. We will just count you up.' We left our packages, women were separated from men, sisters from brothers, women to one side, and the men away to the other side. They then started what was called a selection. They asked us who were tired, and they told these to step into the trucks which were waiting. They also told us that the old people shouldn't exert themselves by walking on foot, and that they should mount the trucks and they would be driven to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, and the young ones should walk. [The next sentence is not clear.] Out of a transport of fifteen hundred people, men, women, and children--a large number were children--we came into the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> two hundred and fifty French girls and women, and the rest climbed into the trucks, the rest of the women and the older men, also the sick, and they told us the trucks go to a second lager. The men were handled the same way as we were when we started our march to the lager. Now we enter. German soldiers lead us. We assemble on a large square--empty, not a tree grows, not a living human being outside--only Germans. And yelling, 'Fast!' and 'Move on!' The words that we already knew well. We looked at each other--to speak was prohibited--and we see that we are already trapped good. When one enters the lager at the gates, there are flowers, beautiful flowers indeed. And the windows are adorned with very beautiful curtains, and you know what these curtains were--Thalsisin [prayer shawls]--Jewish prayer shawls for curtains.<note n="23"><span class="note">Prayer shawl in Hebrew is Tallit; pl. Tallitot.</span><sup><a href="#note_23">23</a></sup></note> I stared at it--my father used to pray every day--and I was thinking, 'How is it that we see a Thaleis, a Jewish Thaleis on these windows--hung up there?' And that meant a lot. The hanging of the prayer shawls meant a lot. We were moved into a barracks, we were locked up for all night with no food, no drink. We didn't have anymore our things. They called in girls from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, Slovakian girls, Jewish, and they started first of all to take off our "fingers" the golden things that one had, watches, engagement rings--all that was taken off. </span>

Why wasn't it very strict? Because they knew that in <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Oświęcim</a> they would be taken away. And immediately they started to tattoo us. That means to write the number on our hands. Many fainted. I personally revived three of my acquaintances. With a pen they wrote the numbers on our hands with a special ink--the number which I still have today, first, because it won't come off, and second, because I don't want to remove it.<note n="24"><span class="note">Henja's decision not to remove the tattoo on her left arm was prompted by her desire to bear witness to what she had endured and to remind the world of the evils of Nazism. It was the imperative to bear witness which helped strengthen her will to live in Auschwitz. But the tattoo was also a painful daily reminder of all that she had suffered and all that she had lost.</span><sup><a href="#note_24">24</a></sup></note> The number was written on, and hungry, in dirt and in the cold--in spite of the fact that it was in the month of June, it is very cold in upper Silesia--we lay down to sleep on the ground. One German woman was with us in the barracks, and she said that we would have to manage this night, and tomorrow we would go into our barracks. That night, the first night, we couldn't sleep, couldn't believe it was we who lived that way. Lying on the floor, we were frightfully tired. One of our friends were insane and was yelling, because things made a terrible impression on her. She was in panic.</span>

We finally lived to see the dawn, the day of <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. That is, the day begins at 4:00. A husky German women from those--with a black triangle, which we learned afterwards meant a German prostitute, started pushing us around, and led us to what was called a shower bath. That is, where people went to bathe. On the way to the "zaune" [shower-bath] we had to stand in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, on the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> street they called it, and it was the hour when the men assembled to go to work. And we hear music. A march of death--exactly a march of death. We see how men are beaten, and people scream, and men fall, --one cannot call them men. They had no more the appearance of men. Frightfully thin, dressed in rags, faces full of panic, in tatters, marching five abreast, and singing because they were ordered to sing.</span>

Naked men worked in the zaune, prisoners, and in front of the German men and women undressed, naked, and left their things. From above a man and two or three of them looked at us; our eyes were fixed on the earth, and we could not believe what was happening. First of all, we were taken to the shearing room. Again Slovakian girls--why Slovakians? Because they were the first prisoners in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> -those were girls about twenty years of age, those who managed to survive the year of torment. Then in the year '43. They started talking to us, and we asked them, the first question, where did the truck go on which our parents went off and our other friends.</span>

There is where all the people went, on the trucks!' We remained standing. We thought she was out of her mind. But from one after another we heard the same story. All who climbed into the trucks are in the crematories. An hour later they showed us a fire which rose from the chimneys. Those are the bodies which burned, they gave us to understand. These old prisoners. And that we could see. We saw it burning, burning intensely. We felt the smell of skin, living skin. We are in the "zaune," in the shearing room. They shear off our hair. As they do it to me, completely. A clipper went over our heads. All the hair from the head. We look at each other. The fright. People are beaten. Hair is being shorn. People scream.

Man's trousers and men's shirts. Worn, dirty. We are also given men's underclothes. There were girls who were menstruating. They did not pay attention to it. Under the cold shower, they were given no things, and so they remained. There is no need to describe how they look. Dressed in rags, and tatters, and these were clothes of Russian prisoners. We even found buttons on these clothes with the hammer and sickle. A kerchief to hide the hair that was absent, and we go to the bureau. The Germans register us.

However, the information was under-reported and considered exaggerated by many. The Polish government in exile in London had included Auschwitz in a list of camps where Nazi atrocities were taking place in July 1942, and a Polish resistance message in March 1943 mentioned Auschwitz as one of the camps where Jews were being killed. The western Allies obtained definitive information about the camp as a result of the April 1944 escape of two prisoners, Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler. Knowledge of the mass exterminations at Auschwitz prompted a number of successful protests to Admiral Horthy, head of the Hungarian government, to halt transports of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz in July 1944. However, the call for the bombing of the camp was rejected by the Allies, who would not even consider the possibility. The passionate debate about whether or not Auschwitz should have been bombed continues, but apart from the question of whether or not it would have succeeded, an attempt to bomb the gas chambers or the railroad lines leading to Auschwitz would have made a significant moral statement.</span><sup><a href="#note_25">25</a></sup></note> People don't want to believe.

It is a pity, but it is just so. But this is already another chapter. This 'count <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">Appell</a>' lasted exactly three hours. For three hours we were standing and waiting for them to come and count us up. Hungry we were, cold we were, frightened we were, because we saw where we were. To describe exactly what was going on in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, I can't. I am telling the truth. I can't. There I saw around me corpses. Girls with tortured faces. Constantly screaming. I did not believe then that I would ever live among people again. I thought that I had fallen into a different world. Completely different world. In my disordered thoughts, I reasoned, maybe, there is more than one world, a world where one lives normally, but that possibly there is also another world, where life is entirely different, and in such a life people also do live. I thought so then because I believed that one could not stand it, that one could not live through <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. But I had to live through, I must live through to be able to come back and tell to the world what I have seen. I have returned, but to tell it is not so easy. Mornings we were going to work. I will give you now an account of the work. I will tell you what kind of work we did. We got up at four o'clock in the morning. It was dark and cold. At night we couldn't sleep, because we slept eight or ten people on one bed that was four meters wide and four meters long. I don't speak about the food, because we were getting a little piece of black bread of about 200 grams [half a pound] for the whole day. Lice, vermin, as they say in French--were crawling over us as if we were prisoners already a long, long, time. By the hundreds; one could not stand it or sleep at night, so badly were we itching from the lice, the bedbugs, the fleas.</span>

In the year 1943 it wasn't called anymore an extermination camp, but a work camp, and the slogan of the Germans was "work makes free." Our slogan was "Work makes free in the crematories two and three." And our slogan was most correct. As I have already said, we got up at four o'clock in the morning. And that day it was raining. Right the first day we were sent to work. For two hours we were standing for the count-<a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">Appell</a>. That means until six o'clock. Five abreast and a <a class="term" href="#vothG_capo">capo</a>, a German again, a German prostitute. They had very low elements to manage the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, because normal people, clean people, would not have been capable of such management. A <a class="term" href="#vothG_capo">capo</a> led us to the gate, and again there are standing a whole group of German elite. That German, the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> <a class="term" href="#vothG_commandant">commandant</a>, the work <a class="term" href="#vothG_fuehrer">Fuehrer</a>, and all the company leaders, the German soldiers who were leading us to work and who guarded us. Every soldier was leading a dog, to guard us and watch us. Without a word, just 'left'...'left'...We marched through the gate, and the Germans looked at the women who had arrived yesterday, beautiful and young, and they laughed at the derelicts into which they had been converted in one day.</span>

If he had a chance to set the dog on us, he did so as well. One company leader, that is, a German soldier, got out of formation and marched among us, leading us straight. 'Left'...just like soldiers so we shouldn't forget to step first with the left foot and all together. Many women didn't know what it means, 'left'. They were mother of children, and all at once they had become soldiers and did not know 'left'. They paid dearly for it. The punishment was a bad beating. Everyone wanted to march inside the formation, because on the sides one would be exposed to blows. In front one was responsible for the stop. We had to walk very fast. Inside the formation one could escape the blows. The mud was deep and heavy. The terrain was as if made to order for a <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. It was pouring rain, and one could not drag his legs out of the ground. One was unable to walk, especially with those shoes, which were too large. How many kilometers we marched I don't know. About the beatings we were given, about the girls and women, well, I don't have to tell you. People fell, stepped one over the other; there was no time to turn around. It was pouring. The chimneys were on fire at the same time. A German was yelling. Some of us were weeping. They couldn't walk. The shoes were too large, and they fell. What can one do? What should on do? We arrived. I think we walked eight kilometers through a big field. We were ordered to take off our shoes. You know what for? We should not wear out the shoes. We took off our shoes. We were ordered to step into the water. There was a pond, with dirty water. There was a pond, and we had to go into the water up to the head and lift weeds out of the water. What they needed those for I don't know. It really wasn't any work. It was ordered simply to torture us.<note n="26"><span class="note">The kind of work Henja describes was indeed often used at Auschwitz to torture the prisoners and weaken their will to resist by breaking their spirit. In this case, it served as a brutal initiation into the what the prisoners could expect in the camp.

If a woman was too stout, he would beat her on the breasts and say to her, 'You, fat one, you must get a bit thinner.' And to the girls he would say, 'You young girls, you want to get out of here. You'll croak here in my place.' And that badly depressed our morale. He had a stick ten centemeters thick. Every day he had another club. He tried on us "all models."

The word gas means in Yiddish and in colloquial German a "street" (Gasse), the "outdoors." Gehen in gas under ordinary circumstances means: to go out, to take a walk, to look for incidental business to panhandle. It was therefore somewhat difficult to get into the habit of associating the words gehen in gas with their new connotation--to die in the gas chambers. This was especially difficult because the interviewees pronounced the expression with so much fluency and matter-of-factness that it really sounded like they would say "he just stepped out", or "they are out for a walk".] because children were separated from the mother, and they were sent into the gas.

Not only death to the one who tries to escape, run away, but death to all those who are there. Now I shall start the chapter, the general chapter about the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. By that I mean, about the psychology of the Germans. Why and how they have led people to the state in which we found ourselves. First of all, they made Jews, old prisoners, responsible for the management of a <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>. They made the Jewish physicians, the doctors, responsible for selecting the sick from the hospital--because afterward there was a hospital--and sending them into the gas. They made Jews responsible for management of the work. They [the Germans] only had to receive their reports and to see to it that their orders were complied with. And that is why we saw Jews beating Jews, and that is why we hear now that bandits have come out of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. That is, the Germans have made bandits out of the Jews. They led them into a situation in which they had no time to think. There was no such thing among us as thinking. We did not think. I don't say. I personally was fortunate not to have any responsibilities. I was just a common prisoner. I was not hated like the prisoners who had responsible positions. A Jew would beat a Jew, because Germans were strict, and the German would beat the Jew who did not want to beat another Jew. Jews worked in the crematories, which means that Jews have been burning their own kindred, because the first day when they came to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> they would be assigned to such positions, and the Germans looked on, and ordered them to start fires and to burn.<note n="29"><span class="note">The SS employed a system of "prisoner self-administration" throughout the camp system. Yet one should be cautious in stereotyping the Jews who served as capos and in other responsible positions in Auschwitz. Many acted in the way Henja describes. They were cruel and ruthless. Yet there were some who sought in various ways to alleviate the plight of the prisoners and engage in different forms of clandestine resistance.</span><sup><a href="#note_29">29</a></sup></note></span>

They burned the bodies because, before the people went through the gas chambers, they told the people that they were going bathing, that they were going to take a shower. And these gas chambers, according to a report from a friend I have who worked there, looked exactly like a shower bath. Little holes for the water to come through, but instead of water would come through gas. And in this way the people were destroyed. And from there to the crematories, like into a bakery. The system went like this. There was room in the furnace for three people, a stout one, a thin one, and a very thin one. And those three people were shoved in, and they burned. And so the crematories were arranged. They were in <a class="placename" href="#vothC10" type="camp">Birkenau</a>, six crematories, which have been working day and night with interruption.<note n="30"><span class="note">In Birkenau, there were four crematoria which had the capacity to burn 4,416 bodies on a daily basis.</span><sup><a href="#note_30">30</a></sup></note> [Pause]. I shall not continue in order. I shall speak about the things that pass now through my thoughts. I was in Krankenburg. That is, the hospital--one may call it a "hospital". I was sick with typhus, spotted typhus, and pneumonia in addition. I was for three months in a hospital. You may ask why I was three months in a hospital. Well, they did nothing to heal us. I survived the three months of the hospital just due to my character. I was not far from death. I did not look like a human being anymore. Only my thoughts were still human. I was thinking about getting away. My fever was 40-41 degress C. It wasn't possible to stand it. All at once the Germans came in and ordered that the whole hospital be sent into the gas, all the sick. They said that otherwise we might infect the whole <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>; and we were registered, and we were expecting that trucks will come to take us to the gas. I thought that I would not let them take me into the gas. I had in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> a girl friend whose name was Molly Zinnenbaum [??], from Belgium. She was a messenger.<note n="31"><span class="note">"Molly Zinnenbaum" is actually Mala Zimetbaum, an Auschwitz heroine, who at the age of twenty arrived in Auschwitz in 1942 on a transport of Jews from Belgium. Mala became a courier and an interpreter in the camp due to her fluency in several languages. As Henja's experiences illustrate, Mala, despite the risks, went to great lengths to help fellow prisoners. Mala met a Polish prisoner named Adek Galinski, and the two fell in love. With the help of the camp underground the pair escaped in June 1944. Mala was the first woman to successfully do so. However, they were recaptured and returned to the camp. Henja relates what occurred to Mala subsequently. Adek also died defiantly. What role Mala played in securing Henja's position as a "nurse" in the camp "hospital" is not stated. This indoor job was another factor in Henja's survival</span><sup><a href="#note_31">31</a></sup></note></span>

She was in contact with the woman <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> manager, the German, and she did a lot for us, and she saved me from the gas. She said that I was her cousin, and that if I am being sent to the gas, she should be, also. And since the Germans needed her in their work, I was excluded from the list, and I was out of that. There followed two or three more of such moments, and the same Molly saved me. The same Molly was shot in <a class="placename" href="#vothC10" type="camp">Birkenau</a> in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> where I was because she escaped from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>.

Present were the work service of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> commander, and the whole top authority of the Germans. After the speech Molly was to be executed. The work service leaders approached Molly and wanted to tie her hands. And all at once one sees that blood is flowing from Molly. What has happened? Molly knew what was in store for her.

Many people in France do not earn more than I do, and they live. One adapts himself to any conditions. It is not hard for me, because anything is good for me, because now I have liberty. Of course, it isn't what I expected, because I returned and there was no home; there are no parents. My brothers, whom I loved dearly, are no more. So life doesn't mean much now. I often wonder why I got out, and why they remained there. But one should not talk; it doesn't help. Everyone understands what it does to a person's heart to lose his parents in such tragic times, because we know that when a person dies his own death, nothing can be done. That is a matter of nature. But when one knows that the parents have gone into gas, that is very hard; it is very hard to bear such a thought.<note n="36"><span class="note">As Henja notes, liberation for the survivors was bittersweet.

            In 1924, when Henja was born, Pinsk was in eastern Poland. Today it is part of Belarus. Between the two wars, anti-Semitism and the economic downturn caused by the Great Depression led to large scale Jewish emigration from Pinsk.

            Drancy was administered by the French from August 21,1941 to July 1, 1943, after which it was run by the Germans until August 17, 1944. The collaborationist Vichy regime greatly facilitated German rule in France.

            The language pattern noted here by Boder might have been linked to the stress experienced by the interviewees in recalling their traumatic experiences, the tension caused by the interview process, and the time interviewees spent with persecuted victims of other nationalities.

            This is precisely what occurred immediately after the liberation of the concentration camps. Many of the newly freed inmates became sick and died due to the effects of the sudden change in diet, which their weakened bodies could not handle.

            In 1942 Auschwitz was in fact both a concentration and extermination camp, and remained so until the fall of 1944 when Heinrich Himmler ordered the dismantling of its gas chambers and crematoria. Subsequently, of course, inmates continued to die from other causes. The sign Henja is referring to might have been the cynical, ironic sign, "Arbeit Macht Frei" ("Work Sets You Free").

            The French communist resistance movement was energized by the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June 21, 1941 and the abrogation of the Stalin-Hitler Pact. Although Henja was at first in a specifically Jewish section of the communist resistance (which contained a number of Polish-born Jews), she indicates that her section later merged with the general communist resistance movement. The acronym for the military branch of the communist resistance was FTP-MOI.

            Family solidarity helped those persecuted maintain their morale, but it also inhibited active resistance. Young adult children were concerned about their parents and wanted to protect and shelter them as much as they could, rather than undertaking risky actions against the enemy. Later in the interview, Henja reveals that family solidarity inhibited escape attempts from the deportation train.

            It is unclear whether or not the concierge knew that the French police were waiting for Henja in her room and failed to warn her. It is, however, indisputable that Vichy's anti-Semitic policies could not have been carried out without the complicity of countless ordinary French citizens. The official post-war French view, which divided French men and women into a majority of heroic resisters and a minority of cowardly collaborators, is untrue.

            It appears that the inspectors who arrested Henja were from the section of the French police designated to investigate political subversion rather than the special anti-Jewish police force created by the Vichy government. The French police had records which helped in their identification of suspects.

            The post-war calumny that the Jewish of France meekly accepted their fate is refuted by Henja's account. Henri Michel, a respected historian of the French resistance, estimated that some 25% of the French Jewish community was involved in resistance work, a far greater percentage than that of the general population.

            After mid-November 1942, the food and general living situation at Drancy improved from what they had been at the beginning of the camp's existence with the help of French Jewish organizations.

            <a name="note_17"></a>
            Despite difficult conditions, Jewish religious and cultural life was maintained at Drancy. Engaging in study, giving moral and psychological support, and dancing and singing to lift spirits should be considered as forms of resistance. Subsequently, Henja relates that when she and others were deported to Drancy they were singing.

            Alois Brunner, one of Adolf Eichmann's chief assistants, assumed command of Drancy on July 2, 1943. Before coming to Drancy he had helped deport Jews from Vienna, Moravia and Greece. Once installed at Drancy, Brunner removed the Vichy-appointed camp commander and ran it with the help of SS officers. His rule was characterized by a marked deterioration of conditions for the inmates and concerted efforts to deport imprisoned Jews to Auschwitz. After the war Brunner disappeared. He was not tried at Nuremberg, but was tried in absentia in Paris in 1954 and sentenced to death. However, he was eventually granted asylum in Syria and lived there for many years under an assumed name. Brunner was never brought to justice.

            This feigned solicitousness towards the victims was typical of Nazi deception. Later Henja recounts how upon the arrival of her transport at Auschwitz, the SS asked those who were old or weak to board trucks which would take them into the camp so they wouldn't have to walk. The trucks went straight to the gas chambers. It is unclear who the "he" to whom Henja refers might be.

            Henja was imprisoned in Auschwitz from the end of June 1943 until her liberation by the Red Army on January 27, 1945. Indeed, ordinary language cannot begin to convey the horrors of the deepest circle of the Nazi hell or what has been called "planet Auschwitz."

            Henja's decision not to remove the tattoo on her left arm was prompted by her desire to bear witness to what she had endured and to remind the world of the evils of Nazism. It was the imperative to bear witness which helped strengthen her will to live in Auschwitz. But the tattoo was also a painful daily reminder of all that she had suffered and all that she had lost.

            Information regarding the murder of European Jewry had been known and publicized in the West since the Einsatzagruppen massacres in the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941. However, the information was under-reported and considered exaggerated by many. The Polish government in exile in London had included Auschwitz in a list of camps where Nazi atrocities were taking place in July 1942, and a Polish resistance message in March 1943 mentioned Auschwitz as one of the camps where Jews were being killed. The western Allies obtained definitive information about the camp as a result of the April 1944 escape of two prisoners, Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler. Knowledge of the mass exterminations at Auschwitz prompted a number of successful protests to Admiral Horthy, head of the Hungarian government, to halt transports of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz in July 1944. However, the call for the bombing of the camp was rejected by the Allies, who would not even consider the possibility. The passionate debate about whether or not Auschwitz should have been bombed continues, but apart from the question of whether or not it would have succeeded, an attempt to bomb the gas chambers or the railroad lines leading to Auschwitz would have made a significant moral statement.

            The kind of work Henja describes was indeed often used at Auschwitz to torture the prisoners and weaken their will to resist by breaking their spirit. In this case, it served as a brutal initiation into the what the prisoners could expect in the camp. They had no rights whatsoever, and the scope of SS power over them was unlimited.

            Prisoner solidarity, such as that described here and elsewhere by Henja, was a crucial element in promoting survival. Despite the horrendous conditions they had to endure, many prisoners helped each other.

            Henja's horrifying account of her first day in Auschwitz demonstrates why the average prisoner who was admitted into the camp could not live more than a few months. The exhausting work, starvation diet, painfully long Appels and other sadistic acts resulted in feelings of helplessness and hopelessness and turned many prisoners into muselmanner, the living dead. Nevertheless, there were prisoners like Henja who, despite illness, exhaustion, and deprivation, managed to survive through solidarity with others, living one moment at a time, and luck.

            The SS employed a system of "prisoner self-administration" throughout the camp system. Yet one should be cautious in stereotyping the Jews who served as capos and in other responsible positions in Auschwitz. Many acted in the way Henja describes. They were cruel and ruthless. Yet there were some who sought in various ways to alleviate the plight of the prisoners and engage in different forms of clandestine resistance.

            "Molly Zinnenbaum" is actually Mala Zimetbaum, an Auschwitz heroine, who at the age of twenty arrived in Auschwitz in 1942 on a transport of Jews from Belgium. Mala became a courier and an interpreter in the camp due to her fluency in several languages. As Henja's experiences illustrate, Mala, despite the risks, went to great lengths to help fellow prisoners. Mala met a Polish prisoner named Adek Galinski, and the two fell in love. With the help of the camp underground the pair escaped in June 1944. Mala was the first woman to successfully do so. However, they were recaptured and returned to the camp. Henja relates what occurred to Mala subsequently. Adek also died defiantly. What role Mala played in securing Henja's position as a "nurse" in the camp "hospital" is not stated. This indoor job was another factor in Henja's survival

            The murderously effective SS master sergeant Otto Moll was transferred to Auschwitz in the spring of 1944 to supervise the efficient running of the machinery to exterminate the tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews being transported there. He became head of the gas chambers and crematoria in Birkenau. After the war, in November 1945, Moll was tried and executed.

            Poles were the first prisoners incarcerated in Auschwitz. Some 75,000 perished there.

            Katowice was the provincial capital of upper Silesia and was located not far from Auschwitz. After the war, it was indeed a gathering point for Jewish refugees. From Katowice, it was a long journey to the Russian Black Sea port of Odessa from where Henja embarked on her voyage to France.

            Henja is speaking about a section of the camp known as "Canada" where some 600 female prisoners sorted the belongings stolen from those arriving at  the camp. Though all the valuables were supposedly the property of the Reich, SS men regularly stole items from "Canada," thus personally profiting from them. This was but a part of the corruption that pervaded Auschwitz.

            As Henja notes, liberation for the survivors was bittersweet. They regained their liberty but were forever scarred by their painful experiences and losses. Like so many others, Henja experienced survivor guilt, questioning why she survived while so many others perished.

                <li>
            <a name="note_37"></a>
            Henja's ideological commitment played a role in her survival by bolstering her will and spirit. It gave her a motive for surviving: to live in order to build a more just and humane world and to take part in the ongoing struggle against fascism.

                <li>

            The oft-repeated message of the survivors is that the unthinkable and unimaginable happened and that it can happen again. Therefore human society must strive to prevent future genocides and be alert to their warning signs.

            Ilya Ehrenberg (1891-1967) was a renowned Jewish Soviet Russian writer and journalist. Ehrenberg's loyalty to the Stalinist regime remained firm despite its terroristic actions. However he was a staunch opponent of Nazism and during the war was the Soviet Union's foremost anti-Geman ideologist. He survived the murderous Stalinist purge of Jewish artists during the "Black Years" of 1948-1953, though he never forsook his Jewish identity. After Stalin's death in 1953, Ehrenberg became a key spokesman for Soviet intellectuals seeking liberal reforms and an outspoken opponent of Soviet anti-Semitism.

                The camp was opened after a roundup of in Paris Jews in August, 1941, in which over 4000 Jews were arrested.  Drancy was under the control of the French police until July 3, 1943 when Nazi Germany took day-to-day control as part of the major stepping up at all facilities for the mass exterminations.

            Drancy was administered by the French from August 21,1941 to July 1, 1943, after which it was run by the Germans until August 17, 1944. The collaborationist Vichy regime greatly facilitated German rule in France.

            In 1942 Auschwitz was in fact both a concentration and extermination camp, and remained so until the fall of 1944 when Heinrich Himmler ordered the dismantling of its gas chambers and crematoria. Subsequently, of course, inmates continued to die from other causes. The sign Henja is referring to might have been the cynical, ironic sign, "Arbeit Macht Frei" ("Work Sets You Free").

            The French communist resistance movement was energized by the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June 21, 1941 and the abrogation of the Stalin-Hitler Pact. Although Henja was at first in a specifically Jewish section of the communist resistance (which contained a number of Polish-born Jews), she indicates that her section later merged with the general communist resistance movement. The acronym for the military branch of the communist resistance was FTP-MOI.

            Family solidarity helped those persecuted maintain their morale, but it also inhibited active resistance. Young adult children were concerned about their parents and wanted to protect and shelter them as much as they could, rather than undertaking risky actions against the enemy. Later in the interview, Henja reveals that family solidarity inhibited escape attempts from the deportation train.

            It is unclear whether or not the concierge knew that the French police were waiting for Henja in her room and failed to warn her. It is, however, indisputable that Vichy's anti-Semitic policies could not have been carried out without the complicity of countless ordinary French citizens. The official post-war French view, which divided French men and women into a majority of heroic resisters and a minority of cowardly collaborators, is untrue.

            It appears that the inspectors who arrested Henja were from the section of the French police designated to investigate political subversion rather than the special anti-Jewish police force created by the Vichy government. The French police had records which helped in their identification of suspects.

            The post-war calumny that the Jewish of France meekly accepted their fate is refuted by Henja's account. Henri Michel, a respected historian of the French resistance, estimated that some 25% of the French Jewish community was involved in resistance work, a far greater percentage than that of the general population.

            Despite difficult conditions, Jewish religious and cultural life was maintained at Drancy. Engaging in study, giving moral and psychological support, and dancing and singing to lift spirits should be considered as forms of resistance. Subsequently, Henja relates that when she and others were deported to Drancy they were singing.

            Alois Brunner, one of Adolf Eichmann's chief assistants, assumed command of Drancy on July 2, 1943. Before coming to Drancy he had helped deport Jews from Vienna, Moravia and Greece. Once installed at Drancy, Brunner removed the Vichy-appointed camp commander and ran it with the help of SS officers. His rule was characterized by a marked deterioration of conditions for the inmates and concerted efforts to deport imprisoned Jews to Auschwitz. After the war Brunner disappeared. He was not tried at Nuremberg, but was tried in absentia in Paris in 1954 and sentenced to death. However, he was eventually granted asylum in Syria and lived there for many years under an assumed name. Brunner was never brought to justice.

Later Henja recounts how upon the arrival of her transport at Auschwitz, the SS asked those who were old or weak to board trucks which would take them into the camp so they wouldn't have to walk. The trucks went straight to the gas chambers. It is unclear who the "he" to whom Henja refers might be.

            Henja was imprisoned in Auschwitz from the end of June 1943 until her liberation by the Red Army on January 27, 1945. Indeed, ordinary language cannot begin to convey the horrors of the deepest circle of the Nazi hell or what has been called "planet Auschwitz."

            Henja's decision not to remove the tattoo on her left arm was prompted by her desire to bear witness to what she had endured and to remind the world of the evils of Nazism. It was the imperative to bear witness which helped strengthen her will to live in Auschwitz. But the tattoo was also a painful daily reminder of all that she had suffered and all that she had lost.

            Information regarding the murder of European Jewry had been known and publicized in the West since the Einsatzagruppen massacres in the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941. However, the information was under-reported and considered exaggerated by many. The Polish government in exile in London had included Auschwitz in a list of camps where Nazi atrocities were taking place in July 1942, and a Polish resistance message in March 1943 mentioned Auschwitz as one of the camps where Jews were being killed. The western Allies obtained definitive information about the camp as a result of the April 1944 escape of two prisoners, Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler. Knowledge of the mass exterminations at Auschwitz prompted a number of successful protests to Admiral Horthy, head of the Hungarian government, to halt transports of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz in July 1944. However, the call for the bombing of the camp was rejected by the Allies, who would not even consider the possibility. The passionate debate about whether or not Auschwitz should have been bombed continues, but apart from the question of whether or not it would have succeeded, an attempt to bomb the gas chambers or the railroad lines leading to Auschwitz would have made a significant moral statement.

            The kind of work Henja describes was indeed often used at Auschwitz to torture the prisoners and weaken their will to resist by breaking their spirit. In this case, it served as a brutal initiation into the what the prisoners could expect in the camp. They had no rights whatsoever, and the scope of SS power over them was unlimited.

            Henja's horrifying account of her first day in Auschwitz demonstrates why the average prisoner who was admitted into the camp could not live more than a few months. The exhausting work, starvation diet, painfully long Appels and other sadistic acts resulted in feelings of helplessness and hopelessness and turned many prisoners into muselmanner, the living dead. Nevertheless, there were prisoners like Henja who, despite illness, exhaustion, and deprivation, managed to survive through solidarity with others, living one moment at a time, and luck.

            The SS employed a system of "prisoner self-administration" throughout the camp system. Yet one should be cautious in stereotyping the Jews who served as capos and in other responsible positions in Auschwitz. Many acted in the way Henja describes. They were cruel and ruthless. Yet there were some who sought in various ways to alleviate the plight of the prisoners and engage in different forms of clandestine resistance.

            "Molly Zinnenbaum" is actually Mala Zimetbaum, an Auschwitz heroine, who at the age of twenty arrived in Auschwitz in 1942 on a transport of Jews from Belgium. Mala became a courier and an interpreter in the camp due to her fluency in several languages. As Henja's experiences illustrate, Mala, despite the risks, went to great lengths to help fellow prisoners. Mala met a Polish prisoner named Adek Galinski, and the two fell in love. With the help of the camp underground the pair escaped in June 1944. Mala was the first woman to successfully do so. However, they were recaptured and returned to the camp. Henja relates what occurred to Mala subsequently. Adek also died defiantly. What role Mala played in securing Henja's position as a "nurse" in the camp "hospital" is not stated. This indoor job was another factor in Henja's survival

            The murderously effective SS master sergeant Otto Moll was transferred to Auschwitz in the spring of 1944 to supervise the efficient running of the machinery to exterminate the tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews being transported there. He became head of the gas chambers and crematoria in Birkenau. After the war, in November 1945, Moll was tried and executed.

            Henja is speaking about a section of the camp known as "Canada" where some 600 female prisoners sorted the belongings stolen from those arriving at  the camp. Though all the valuables were supposedly the property of the Reich, SS men regularly stole items from "Canada," thus personally profiting from them. This was but a part of the corruption that pervaded Auschwitz.

            Ilya Ehrenberg (1891-1967) was a renowned Jewish Soviet Russian writer and journalist. Ehrenberg's loyalty to the Stalinist regime remained firm despite its terroristic actions. However he was a staunch opponent of Nazism and during the war was the Soviet Union's foremost anti-Geman ideologist. He survived the murderous Stalinist purge of Jewish artists during the "Black Years" of 1948-1953, though he never forsook his Jewish identity. After Stalin's death in 1953, Ehrenberg became a key spokesman for Soviet intellectuals seeking liberal reforms and an outspoken opponent of Soviet anti-Semitism.
