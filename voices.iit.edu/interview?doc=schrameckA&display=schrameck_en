Twenty-five years of my administrative career and during the same time, elected office in the legislature. I never dreamed when I was very young, the son of an ordinary merchant in the Centre department at <a class="placename" href="#vothL524">St. Etienne</a> Loire,<note n="1"><span class="note">St. Etienne is located in south-eastern France. During the war, it had a population of about 200,000 and was the most important city in the Loire region.</span><sup><a href="#note_1">1</a></sup></note> that I would have a career as a public figure. Circumstances, in their own time, made the decision for me. It turned out that I was invited by the Prefect of the Department<note n="2"><span class="note">The prefect was the head of a department, a governmentally designated administrative area established by the French Revolution of 1789.</span><sup><a href="#note_2">2</a></sup></note> where I was born, to take a position as head of his office. It was Mr. Lépine who invited me, whom I then accompanied to <a class="placename" href="#vothL13">Paris</a>, where he was Prefect of Police and where he is still fondly remembered, because no matter what, no matter how great his successors were, none of them could supplant him in our memories. When I left the Prefecture of Police, when my boss became head of the general governor of Algeria . . . or rather General Governor of Algeria,<note n="3"><span class="note">Algeria was under French colonial control from 1830 until its independence in 1962.</span><sup><a href="#note_3">3</a></sup></note> I started working for myself in <a class="placename" href="#vothL236">Marseille</a>, as secretary general of the prefecture. I stayed a few years. I went to work in two other Departments. I returned to <a class="placename" href="#vothL13">Paris</a> to the Ministry of the Interior to take a management position, and I returned to <a class="placename" href="#vothL236">Marseille</a> to the same Prefecture.

The smoke permeated the house and I had to return to my personal pied-à-terre, up until the moment when I saw Moroccans, or Moroccan troops arriving, descending on the city, and who several days earlier had disembarked in the Mediterranean under orders from General de Lattre de Tassigny.<note n="14"><span class="note">Mr. Schramack is referring here to the Allied assault on southern France which began on August 15, 1944.

            The island of Madagascar was under French colonial rule at the time Mr. Schramack was Governor-General of Madagascar a position he held from August 1918 to July 1919.

            Paul Painlevé (1863-1933) was a brilliant mathematician and a significant political figure during the Third Republic. He was briefly prime minister in 1917 and was succeed by Clemenceau. He became prime minister again from April to November 1925. It was during this time that Mr. Schramack served as minister of the interior. He was denounced by the anti-Semitic, ultra-nationalist politician Charles Maurras, who called for Schramack's assassination after he had ordered the disarming of far-right associations.

            That is, his elected office as a French Senator. Mr. Schramack served four terms as French senator from 1920-1940. In the summer of 1940, he was one of the great majorities of representatives in the National Assembly who voted for the dissolution of the Third Republic. He completed his senatorial mandate in October, 1945.

            Mr. Schramack is speaking here of the post-World War I period when Germany was trying to skirt the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles limiting its armed forces.

                <li>
            <a name="note_10"></a>
            Mr. Schramack's family were part of the old-line French Jewish element who were well-integrated into French society and considered themselves strictly as a religious community. Like Mr. Schramack, most were staunch and sincere French patriots.

            Marshal Philippe Pétain, a hero of World War I, was chief of state of the Vichy French collaborationist government during the German occupation. The politician Pierre Laval dominated the Vichy government from July to December 1940, when he was dismissed by Pétain. In April 1942, aided by German pressure, he was restored to power by Pétain and remained in control of the government until its collapse in August 1944.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_12"></a>
            Georges Mandel, a French Jewish politician, was a former minister of the interior who tried in June 1940 to continue the struggle against Nazi Germany from French North Africa. He was arrested and was eventually shot by the milice, an elite military force of French fascist volunteers, in July 1944.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_13"></a>
            Mr. Schramack, like Mandel and other prominent political figures, was first imprisoned by the Vichy government for three months. He was then placed in a residence where his movements were severely restricted. However, following the Allied landings in North Africa, the Germans occupied the part of France under Vichy control on November 11, 1942. Mr. Schramack then escaped from his confinement and returned to Marseille.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_14"></a>
            Mr. Schramack is referring here to the Allied assault on southern France which began on August 15, 1944. General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny commanded French Army B (later the First French Army) in the Allied landing operations in southern France and then in the liberation of France and advance into Germany.  To the very end of the Occupation, the Vichy regime sought to enforce its anti-Jewish measures and the threat of arrest and deportation hung over the heads of French Jews.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_15"></a>
            There is no doubt that the assistance Mr. Schramack describes help save his life, especially since he was the object of anti-Semitic hatred directed against him by French right-wingers. Of the approximately 77,000 Jews from France who perished during the Holocaust, about one-third were citizens of long standing. 8,700 were age 67 or older.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_16"></a>
            This was but one example of the Nazi zeal for lawless plunder and pillage.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_17"></a>
            Indeed, during the 1930s Laval's fascist sympathies were well-known. He showed little determination to resist fascist territorial aims and advocated a policy of appeasement.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_18"></a>
            Mr. Schramack makes reference here to the early months of the Vichy regime. Laval was responsible for persuading the French National Assembly to dissolve itself after the German victory in June 1940 and subsequent armistice. Thus, the Third Republic ended on July 10, 1940.  Soon thereafter, Marshal Pétain and his advisors embarked upon a series of reforms, grandiloquently termed the National Revolution, advocated by the right-wing traditionalists and authoritarians who surrounded him. The watchwords of the xenophobic and chauvinistic National Revolution were, work, family and patriotism.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_19"></a>
            Mr. Schramack is taking the wise and humane position of not judging others too harshly. They and their families were living in a police state, under foreign occupation, enduring shortages and privations of various kinds and concerned about survival for themselves and their families.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_20"></a>
            Nevertheless, there were those whose compassion, patriotism and courage overcame self-interest, apathy, and fear to extend a helping hand.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_21"></a>
            This remark is out of context so it is difficult to know why Mr. Schramack asked the question. Vincent Auriol served as president of the French Fourth Republic from 1947-1954.

Vichy France was that part of France not occupied by German troops until November 1942. Authoritarian and collaborationist, the Vichy regime cooperated with the Germans even after they had moved to the unoccupied zone in November 1942. It imprisoned some 135,000 people, interned another 70,000, deported some 76,000 Jews, and sent 650,000 French workers to Germany.

He became prime minister again from April to November 1925. It was during this time that Mr. Schramack served as minister of the interior. He was denounced by the anti-Semitic, ultra-nationalist politician Charles Maurras, who called for Schramack's assassination after he had ordered the disarming of far-right associations.

            Marshal Philippe Pétain, a hero of World War I, was chief of state of the Vichy French collaborationist government during the German occupation. The politician Pierre Laval dominated the Vichy government from July to December 1940, when he was dismissed by Pétain. In April 1942, aided by German pressure, he was restored to power by Pétain and remained in control of the government until its collapse in August 1944.

            Mr. Schramack, like Mandel and other prominent political figures, was first imprisoned by the Vichy government for three months. He was then placed in a residence where his movements were severely restricted. However, following the Allied landings in North Africa, the Germans occupied the part of France under Vichy control on November 11, 1942. Mr. Schramack then escaped from his confinement and returned to Marseille.

            Mr. Schramack is referring here to the Allied assault on southern France which began on August 15, 1944. General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny commanded French Army B (later the First French Army) in the Allied landing operations in southern France and then in the liberation of France and advance into Germany.  To the very end of the Occupation, the Vichy regime sought to enforce its anti-Jewish measures and the threat of arrest and deportation hung over the heads of French Jews.

Of the approximately 77,000 Jews from France who perished during the Holocaust, about one-third were citizens of long standing. 8,700 were age 67 or older.

            Mr. Schramack makes reference here to the early months of the Vichy regime. Laval was responsible for persuading the French National Assembly to dissolve itself after the German victory in June 1940 and subsequent armistice. Thus, the Third Republic ended on July 10, 1940.  Soon thereafter, Marshal Pétain and his advisors embarked upon a series of reforms, grandiloquently termed the National Revolution, advocated by the right-wing traditionalists and authoritarians who surrounded him. The watchwords of the xenophobic and chauvinistic National Revolution were, work, family and patriotism.
