The burning capacity of the crematoria was about 8,000 bodies in a twenty-four hour period. The Sonderkommando unit did indeed work around the clock at peak times during the arrival of the Hungarian transports. They did have better rations and accommodations than the other prisoners, but the SS would periodically murder the Sonderkommado because they sought to eliminate witnesses to their mass murder and then replace the Sonderkommando with a new group of prisoners. The number of prisoners working in the Sonderkommando during the extermination of the Hungarian Jews was approximately 1,000.  Then in late 1944 the gas chambers ceased to operate followed  by the evacuation of Auschwitz.</span><sup><a href="#note_27">27</a></sup></note></span>

            Salonika (Thessasloniki) was home to Greece's  largest Jewish community,  a number of whom were descendants of Jews expelled from Spain in 1492 who had sought refuge in the city, then part of the Ottoman empire. Salonika was the most significant Sephardic Jewish religious and cultural center in the world. For four hundred and fifty years, the Jewish community, whether as a majority or as a plurality, was a dominant factor in the city.

            On October 28, 1940, Italian forces crossed the Albanian border and invaded Greece. Mr. Lea was one of the some 13,000 Greek Jews who fought against the invaders. The Greeks acquitted themselves  well against the Italian aggressors and forced them back into Albania.

            Following the German invasion of Greece on April 6, 1941, the Greek army and monarch were evacuated to the Greek island of Crete with the help of the British navy. The Germans launched a massive airborne invasion of Crete on May 20,1941, and the island soon fell to the Germans.

            Jews scheduled for deportation were assembled in the Baron Hirsch quarter of the city. Deportees on the first transports were forced to send attractive postcards to their co-religionists still in Salonika describing their "positive experiences" in Auschwitz-Birkenau.

            Mr. Lea is referring to the notorious "selections" which took place upon the arrival of prisoners in Auschwitz-Birkenau which identified those whom the SS deemed were strong enough for slave labor. Everyone else was sent immediately to the gas chambers.

            Mr. Lea is speaking about the murder of the Hungarian Jewish community in Auschwitz-Birkenau between May 15 and July 9, 1944. During that time, some 434,000 Hungarian Jews, from outside Budapest were deported to the extermination center at Auschwitz. where some 320,000 were sent immediately to the gas chambers. The remainder were sent to slave labor from which many perished. Mr. Lea's figure of 600,000 is exaggerated.

            <a name="note_17"></a>
            The Salonikan Jews in Auschwitz-Birkenau constituted a significant part of the Sonderkommando at the time. Mr. Lea was one of the strong, young Jews selected to perform the hellish tasks assigned to this unit. There is no definitive answer as to why Jews engaged in this work. One may note that some sought to survive to seek revenge, others to bear witness to heinous German crimes and still others because their will to live overcame their revulsion at what they were forced to do. There were Jews who committed suicide rather than serve in the Sonderkommando.

            Mr. Lea was indeed confusing June with January. On January 18, 1945, as the Red Army was approaching Auschwitz, the SS forced marched 58,000 prisoners from the facility on what became for many a death march.

            The effort to deceive those condemned to death continued to the very end when they were told they were going to take a shower. All the gas chambers in the extermination camps were disguised as shower rooms.

            In the gas chambers known as Bunker One and Bunker Two, the SS used vents in the side walls to discharge the Zyklon B gas. In Crematoria II, III, IV and V, constructed between March and June 1943, the gas was introduced through columns shaped like pillars in the gas chambers.
Zyklon B was poured into the columns from an opening in the ceiling here referred to as a "luminette". Some two thousand human beings at one time could be crammed into the gas chambers in Cremtoria II, III IV and V. These units had combined gas chambers and crematoria. The murder operation in the gas chambers took from twenty to thirty minutes.

            Mr. Lea might be indicating that one aspect of his job was to drag the bodies out of the gas chamber while wearing a gas mask after the ventilation of the chamber in preparation for the next set of victims had taken place. He also might have been involved in burning the bodies of the victims in the crematoria.

            Mr. Lea is speaking about the arrival of large numbers of Hungarian Jews. The daily murder of arrivals is exaggerated. The burning capacity of the crematoria was about 8,000 bodies in a twenty-four hour period. The Sonderkommando unit did indeed work around the clock at peak times during the arrival of the Hungarian transports. They did have better rations and accommodations than the other prisoners, but the SS would periodically murder the Sonderkommado because they sought to eliminate witnesses to their mass murder and then replace the Sonderkommando with a new group of prisoners. The number of prisoners working in the Sonderkommando during the extermination of the Hungarian Jews was approximately 1,000.  Then in late 1944 the gas chambers ceased to operate followed  by the evacuation of Auschwitz.

                <li>
            <a name="note_28"></a>
            On October 7, 1944, some 450  members of the Sonderkommando organized an uprising that destroyed Crematorium IV. Some 135 Greek Jews took part in the rebellion. All of those who participated were executed. Mr. Lea was spared execution because he was in the Auschwitz sickbay at the time. The destruction of Crematorium IV was the single most significant act of resistance in Auschwitz. Some Sonderkommando prisoners found other ways to resist. They kept diaries of the horrors they had witnessed and buried them in the ashes surrounding the crematoria. Several were discovered after the war.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_29"></a>
            The explosives used in the destruction of Crematorium IV were supplied by a group of young Polish Jewish women from Auschwitz III (Monowitz) led by the intrepid Roza Robota. They too were executed after having endured excruciating torture.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_30"></a>
            Murder  in the gas chambers came to a halt following the revolt of the Sonderkommado. On November 25, 1944, Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered  the demotion of the crematoria. Elements of two of the Auschwitz gas chambers and crematoria were transferred to the Gross-Rosen camp.

            Dachau was established on March 10, 1933 as the first of the SS organized concentration camps. It became a training ground for SS personnel who staffed other camps and a model for these camps. Contrary to what Boder indicated, there were significant number of Jews in Dachau. Gas chambers were built at the camp but were never used. However, as Mr. Lea notes, there was indeed a crematorium in the camp. It is unclear what Mr. Lea meant when he said, "It is forbidden for the Jewish." At least 31,000 prisoners perished in Dachau some of whom were victims of inhuman medical experiments.

            Gypsies in Auschwitz-Birkenau were incarcerated i n what was known as the  Gypsy family camp (Birkenau IIe) beginning on February 26, 1943. Most of the Gypsies were from Germany and Austria. In Nazi ideology they were considered "a-socials" who were parasitical and "biologically harmful." No conclusive documentary evidence exists as to why the Gypsies were allowed to live in Auschwitz with their families. . On August 2, 1944, after removing some 2,900 Gypsies for slave labor, the remaining nearly 3,000 residents of the Gypsy camp were gassed.

            Mr. Lea was sent to Warsaw along with other Greek Jews several months after the collapse of the rebellion to clean up the ghetto area. He notes that he and other Greek Jews were sent there because they did not speak Polish, and the language barrier would hinder their escape. They were imprisoned in a camp not far from Warsaw's Jewish graveyard.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_36"></a>
            Pawiak was the main prison in Warsaw. What Mr. Lea is saying about it in unclear.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_37"></a>
            Translator's Note: "Bunki" is not a German word—they are obviously talking about "The Bund" (The General Jewish Labor Union, usually just called "Bund"). "Bunki" is possibly Lea's pronunciation of "Bund."
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_38"></a>
            It is also unclear what Mr. Lea means when he is talking about the "Bunki". At one point, he might have meant the Bund, as the translator notes, but another point he seems to be referring to the warren of bunkers in the Warsaw ghetto which sheltered Jews during the rebellion. What became of the "machine gun" he said he stole is not revealed.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_39"></a>
            What one can glean overall from this difficult to interpret testimony of Mr. Lea in this segment is that the Jews from Auschwitz sent to work in Warsaw had to deal with intolerable working conditions due to lack of adequate food, contagious diseases, sadistic kapos and inclement weather.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_40"></a>
            Mr. Lea's testimony here is a bit disjointed. He first speaks about the slave camp in Warsaw
where sick prisoners were murdered with injections but then begins to speak about his experiences in Landsberg, a sub-camp of Dachau where he worked on the burial detail. Insofar as the latter is concerned, it is worth recalling that there were 150 branches of the main Dachau camp in southern Germany and Austria.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_41"></a>
            "Bracha" is the Hebrew word and "Broche" is the Yiddish word for blessing. Mr. Lea's comrade wished to say the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead, for his relative and was killed by the SS man for attempting to do so. In recounting this incident later in the interview, Mr. Lea will note that it was the prisoner's sister for whom he wished to say the Kaddish.

            Translator's Note: He uses the German term for Bavaria, which the interviewer does not seem to understand at first.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_43"></a>
            Does Mr. Lea mean that Landsberg was the final camp he was in before liberation or that many met their final fate (death) in Landsberg? The camp numbers he goes on to relate might have been the sections into which Landsberg was divided.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_44"></a>
            It is possible that what Mr. Lea terms, "Tannberg" was a part of Landsberg. He claims that SS personnel in "Tannberg" were placed on trial in Nuremberg, a city in southern Germany known for its Nazi rallies, by the victorious Allies after the war. The Nuremberg trial of major Nazi war criminals lasted from October 18, 1945 to September 30 and October 1, 1946. Subsequent Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals took place between December, 1946 and April, 1949.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_45"></a>
            Mr. Lea's testimony here is somewhat garbled, but the gist of it is that the SS murdered prisoners with flame throwers as the Americans closed in on the camp. Until the very end of the war, the Nazi obsession with murdering every single Jew possible was undiminished.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_46"></a>
            Mr. Lea goes on to describe incidents of cannibalism engaged in by the desperate, despairing, dehumanized, starving prisoners in Landsberg. On occasion, cannibalism did occur during the Holocaust. It is mentioned in a few survivor accounts. The practice was also carried out by some Soviet prisoners of war who were deliberately  and systematically starved by the Germans.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_47"></a>
            Mr. Lea's native language was Ladino, a mixture of Hebrew, Spanish and Arabic. This language was commonly spoken by the Jews of Salonika and was part of their Sephardic Jewish heritage.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_48"></a>
            There is an inconsistency here in Mr. Lea's testimony. In June and July of 1944, he was working as part of the Sonderkommando in Auschwitz during the deportation of Hungarian Jews. It is more likely that after working in Warsaw  in 1943, he was sent back to Auschwitz where he remained until its evacuation on January 18, 1945. It was subsequent to this that he was put on the train he describes and, after a horrific journey, ultimately ended up in Landsberg.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_49"></a>
            It is perfectly understandable that a man who had suffered as much as Mr. Lea would find  it difficult to sequence correctly all that had happened to him. The emotional and psychological traumas he had endured affected his memory though the individual incidents that he describes in the interview are vividly recalled and remain firmly etched in his mind.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_50"></a>
            Though the 600,000 figure that Mr. Lea states is not correct, it is accurate that the crematoria in Auschwitz-Birkenau were not able to cope with the great number of Hungarian Jews who steadily arrived at the camp. The overwhelmed SS therefore murdered some by burning them alive in huge fire-pits that Mr. Lea describes. Among those murdered in this way were infants and children. In all, some one million one hundred thousand Jews were sent to Auschwitz. One this number approximately one million perished making Auschwitz the largest Jewish graveyard in the world.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_51"></a>
            The vehicle with the "Croix Rouge", the Red Cross emblem that Mr. Lea describes was used by the SS to transport canisters of Zyklon B gas to the gas chambers.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_52"></a>
            Mr. Lea is describing the ghastly medical experiments conducted in Block Ten of the main Auschwitz camp. As he later explains, the sterilization experiments were conducted so that the Nazi regime could perfect methods to prevent "inferior races" from breeding. The first experimental sterilization's were carried out on Greek Jewish women, most probably from Salonika, ages fifteen to eighteen. They were sterilized by x-rays, and their ovaries were removed. After this mutilation and unbearable suffering, they were sent to the gas chambers. The experiments were performed by doctors operating with no medical ethical restraints to limit their sadistic practices.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_53"></a>
            Mr. Lea is referring to the regular "selections" that took place in Auschwitz designed to find those prisoners who could no longer work. They were placed in special barracks for a time and then sent to the gas chambers.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_54"></a>
            Mr. Lea is referencing Siddurs, Jewish prayer books, which had been taken from Jews on the 1944 Hungarian transports by prisoners and secreted by them for religious use.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_55"></a>
            The meaning of "preto" is not clear. The injections of phenol Mr. Lea is describing were given directly into the heart of the victim. The "points" he then mentions might have made by the needle injecting the phenol.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_56"></a>
            Mr. Lea is saying that the SS man he calls Blanca killed his wife and child with injections of poison and then himself as the Americans were approaching. Hitler, Himmler and Josef Goebbels,  Hitler's propaganda minister, were among other fanatic Nazis who also committed suicide before they could be captured. Before their suicides, Goebbels and his wife poisoned their six children.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_57"></a>
            This was typical of the SS who saw themselves as the masters of life and death.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_58"></a>
            Mr. Lea is speaking about German civilians after the war. Their willful ignorance and criminal indifference made them complicit in Nazi atrocities.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_59"></a>
            Despite all that he had been through, Mr. Lea was attempting to care for another survivor. He expressed the hope of many survivors  at the time to be allowed to emigrate to Palestine, then under British control, and fight for a state where Jews could live in freedom. His reference to "I a Lebanese" is not clear, but it could mean he was a "Levantine", a former inhabitant of a country,
Greece, in the eastern Mediterranean.

                    Acronym for the German Schutzstaffel (“Protective Echelon”), a major Nazi organization. It grew from a small paramilitary unit to a powerful force that served as Hitler's "Praetorian Guard," the Nazi Party's "Shield Squadron" and a force that, fielding almost a million men (both on the front lines and as political police), managed to exert as much political influence as the German Army. Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.

            Salonika (Thessasloniki) was home to Greece's  largest Jewish community,  a number of whom were descendants of Jews expelled from Spain in 1492 who had sought refuge in the city, then part of the Ottoman empire. Salonika was the most significant Sephardic Jewish religious and cultural center in the world. For four hundred and fifty years, the Jewish community, whether as a majority or as a plurality, was a dominant factor in the city.

            The Salonikan Jews in Auschwitz-Birkenau constituted a significant part of the Sonderkommando at the time. Mr. Lea was one of the strong, young Jews selected to perform the hellish tasks assigned to this unit. There is no definitive answer as to why Jews engaged in this work. One may note that some sought to survive to seek revenge, others to bear witness to heinous German crimes and still others because their will to live overcame their revulsion at what they were forced to do. There were Jews who committed suicide rather than serve in the Sonderkommando.

            In the gas chambers known as Bunker One and Bunker Two, the SS used vents in the side walls to discharge the Zyklon B gas. In Crematoria II, III, IV and V, constructed between March and June 1943, the gas was introduced through columns shaped like pillars in the gas chambers.
Zyklon B was poured into the columns from an opening in the ceiling here referred to as a "luminette". Some two thousand human beings at one time could be crammed into the gas chambers in Cremtoria II, III IV and V. These units had combined gas chambers and crematoria. The murder operation in the gas chambers took from twenty to thirty minutes.

            Mr. Lea might be indicating that one aspect of his job was to drag the bodies out of the gas chamber while wearing a gas mask after the ventilation of the chamber in preparation for the next set of victims had taken place. He also might have been involved in burning the bodies of the victims in the crematoria.

            Mr. Lea is speaking about the arrival of large numbers of Hungarian Jews. The daily murder of arrivals is exaggerated. The burning capacity of the crematoria was about 8,000 bodies in a twenty-four hour period. The Sonderkommando unit did indeed work around the clock at peak times during the arrival of the Hungarian transports. They did have better rations and accommodations than the other prisoners, but the SS would periodically murder the Sonderkommado because they sought to eliminate witnesses to their mass murder and then replace the Sonderkommando with a new group of prisoners. The number of prisoners working in the Sonderkommando during the extermination of the Hungarian Jews was approximately 1,000.  Then in late 1944 the gas chambers ceased to operate followed  by the evacuation of Auschwitz.

            On October 7, 1944, some 450  members of the Sonderkommando organized an uprising that destroyed Crematorium IV. Some 135 Greek Jews took part in the rebellion. All of those who participated were executed. Mr. Lea was spared execution because he was in the Auschwitz sickbay at the time. The destruction of Crematorium IV was the single most significant act of resistance in Auschwitz. Some Sonderkommando prisoners found other ways to resist. They kept diaries of the horrors they had witnessed and buried them in the ashes surrounding the crematoria. Several were discovered after the war.

            Murder  in the gas chambers came to a halt following the revolt of the Sonderkommado. On November 25, 1944, Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered  the demotion of the crematoria. Elements of two of the Auschwitz gas chambers and crematoria were transferred to the Gross-Rosen camp.

            Dachau was established on March 10, 1933 as the first of the SS organized concentration camps. It became a training ground for SS personnel who staffed other camps and a model for these camps. Contrary to what Boder indicated, there were significant number of Jews in Dachau. Gas chambers were built at the camp but were never used. However, as Mr. Lea notes, there was indeed a crematorium in the camp. It is unclear what Mr. Lea meant when he said, "It is forbidden for the Jewish." At least 31,000 prisoners perished in Dachau some of whom were victims of inhuman medical experiments.

            Gypsies in Auschwitz-Birkenau were incarcerated i n what was known as the  Gypsy family camp (Birkenau IIe) beginning on February 26, 1943. Most of the Gypsies were from Germany and Austria. In Nazi ideology they were considered "a-socials" who were parasitical and "biologically harmful." No conclusive documentary evidence exists as to why the Gypsies were allowed to live in Auschwitz with their families. . On August 2, 1944, after removing some 2,900 Gypsies for slave labor, the remaining nearly 3,000 residents of the Gypsy camp were gassed.

            Mr. Lea was sent to Warsaw along with other Greek Jews several months after the collapse of the rebellion to clean up the ghetto area. He notes that he and other Greek Jews were sent there because they did not speak Polish, and the language barrier would hinder their escape. They were imprisoned in a camp not far from Warsaw's Jewish graveyard.

            It is possible that what Mr. Lea terms, "Tannberg" was a part of Landsberg. He claims that SS personnel in "Tannberg" were placed on trial in Nuremberg, a city in southern Germany known for its Nazi rallies, by the victorious Allies after the war. The Nuremberg trial of major Nazi war criminals lasted from October 18, 1945 to September 30 and October 1, 1946. Subsequent Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals took place between December, 1946 and April, 1949.

            There is an inconsistency here in Mr. Lea's testimony. In June and July of 1944, he was working as part of the Sonderkommando in Auschwitz during the deportation of Hungarian Jews. It is more likely that after working in Warsaw  in 1943, he was sent back to Auschwitz where he remained until its evacuation on January 18, 1945. It was subsequent to this that he was put on the train he describes and, after a horrific journey, ultimately ended up in Landsberg.

            Though the 600,000 figure that Mr. Lea states is not correct, it is accurate that the crematoria in Auschwitz-Birkenau were not able to cope with the great number of Hungarian Jews who steadily arrived at the camp. The overwhelmed SS therefore murdered some by burning them alive in huge fire-pits that Mr. Lea describes. Among those murdered in this way were infants and children. In all, some one million one hundred thousand Jews were sent to Auschwitz. One this number approximately one million perished making Auschwitz the largest Jewish graveyard in the world.

            Mr. Lea is describing the ghastly medical experiments conducted in Block Ten of the main Auschwitz camp. As he later explains, the sterilization experiments were conducted so that the Nazi regime could perfect methods to prevent "inferior races" from breeding. The first experimental sterilization's were carried out on Greek Jewish women, most probably from Salonika, ages fifteen to eighteen. They were sterilized by x-rays, and their ovaries were removed. After this mutilation and unbearable suffering, they were sent to the gas chambers. The experiments were performed by doctors operating with no medical ethical restraints to limit their sadistic practices.

            Mr. Lea is referring to the regular "selections" that took place in Auschwitz designed to find those prisoners who could no longer work. They were placed in special barracks for a time and then sent to the gas chambers.

            Mr. Lea is referencing Siddurs, Jewish prayer books, which had been taken from Jews on the 1944 Hungarian transports by prisoners and secreted by them for religious use.

            The meaning of "preto" is not clear. The injections of phenol Mr. Lea is describing were given directly into the heart of the victim. The "points" he then mentions might have made by the needle injecting the phenol.

            Mr. Lea is saying that the SS man he calls Blanca killed his wife and child with injections of poison and then himself as the Americans were approaching. Hitler, Himmler and Josef Goebbels,  Hitler's propaganda minister, were among other fanatic Nazis who also committed suicide before they could be captured. Before their suicides, Goebbels and his wife poisoned their six children.

            This was typical of the SS who saw themselves as the masters of life and death.

            Mr. Lea is speaking about German civilians after the war. Their willful ignorance and criminal indifference made them complicit in Nazi atrocities.

            Despite all that he had been through, Mr. Lea was attempting to care for another survivor. He expressed the hope of many survivors  at the time to be allowed to emigrate to Palestine, then under British control, and fight for a state where Jews could live in freedom. His reference to "I a Lebanese" is not clear, but it could mean he was a "Levantine", a former inhabitant of a country,
Greece, in the eastern Mediterranean.
