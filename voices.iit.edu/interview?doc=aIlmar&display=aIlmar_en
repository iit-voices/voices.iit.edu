            Boder repeatedly mispronounces the interviewee's name. Ilmar, however, is one of the most common Estonian given names, which speaks for "Ilmar" as the correct name.

            This phrase is difficult to discern, but it appears he says something ending with "hafen." The most probable place would be Gotenhafen, a subcamp of the Stutthof concentration camp. Many Baltic slave laborers were evacuated to Stutthof in August-September 1944.

            "Tief" means "low"; "Hoch" means "high." These two terms designate two branches of construction –- having to do with constructions that are either below or above the ground.
