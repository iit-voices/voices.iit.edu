The revolt was supported by conservative elements in the country. When the initial military coup failed to win control of the entire country,  bloody civil war ensued, which was fought with great ferocity on both sides. The nationalists-as the rebels were called-received aid from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The republicans received help from the Soviet Union as well as from the International Brigades, sympathetic volunteers who came from other European countries and the United States.</span><sup><a href="#note_3">3</a></sup></note></span>

            Nino Barzilai's native language was Ladino, which was spoken by many Sephardic Jews (Jews who originally came from Spain) who lived in the Balkans. Ladino contains elements of Spanish and Hebrew. Ladino's Spanish component enabled Nino Barzilai to speak Spanish in a fluent manner.

            Thessaloniki or Salonika was home to the most flourishing Sephardic Jewish community in the world before the Holocaust. Nearly all of its pre-war Jewish population of some 56,000 perished in the Holocaust, most of them in Auschwitz-Birkenau. The vibrant Sephardic Jewish community of Salonika, the heart of Sephardic world Jewry, was almost totally annihilated.

            The Spanish Civil War (1936-39) began with a military revolt led by General Francisco Franco against the republican government in Spain. The revolt was supported by conservative elements in the country. When the initial military coup failed to win control of the entire country,  bloody civil war ensued, which was fought with great ferocity on both sides. The nationalists-as the rebels were called-received aid from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The republicans received help from the Soviet Union as well as from the International Brigades, sympathetic volunteers who came from other European countries and the United States.

            The Italian army attacked Greece on October 28, 1940. The Greeks fought valiantly, and the war stalemated for a time. Even though the Spanish Civil War ended in 1939, Spain was a ravaged and devastated country.

            Mr. Barzilai and his family were among the thousands of Greek Jews who fled to Athens seeking sanctuary in the benevolent Italian zone of occupation. In 1941, the Athenian Jewish population was some 3,500. During the time of the Italian occupation (April, 1941-September, 1943), it rose to between eight thousand to ten thousand.

            The Germans invaded Greece on April 6, 1941 and by the end of the month, along with its Italian and Bulgarian allies, conquered the whole of the country. Athens, where the Barzilai's had fled, was in the Italian zone of occupation until Italy went over to the Allied side in September, 1943. On September 8, 1943, the Germans occupied Athens. From the outset, they instituted anti-Jewish such as the measures such as the confiscation of Jewish property, which resulted in the impoverishment of the community and plunged many Jews into destitution.

            Rabbi Barzilai courageously refused to cooperate with the Germans. He destroyed the Jewish communal lists they demanded and exhorted the Jews to flee. He escaped with the help of the Greek partisan network to the mountains of central Greece where he issued calls to the Western powers to aid the main Greek resistance group to save the Jews and fight the Germans. A number of Greek Jews were active in the resistance.

            The Haidary concentration camp operated  from September 2, 1943 to September 20, 1944. It was located in the town of Haidary near Athens. The majority of its inmates were transported to Bergen-Belsen or to Auschwitz.

            Moving stones and sand for no purpose and other forms of useless labor were used in many concentration camps for tormenting and weakening the prisoners.

            Portugal and Spain remained neutral throughout World War II. Contrary to most Latin American countries, which declared war on Germany in 1941 and 1942 (after the United States had entered the war),  Argentina maintained a policy of neutrality during the war motivated by anti-American, anti-democratic and anti-communist sentiments among its ruling elite. It was not until March, 1945, two months before the German surrender, that Argentina declared  war on Nazi Germany.

            Bergen-Belsen was a Nazi concentration camp near Hanover, Germany, established in April, 1943. During the first eighteen months of the camp's existence, five satellite camps were established, one of which was the "neutral camp" in which Mr. Barzilai and his family were interned.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_13"></a>
            What Mr. Barzilai meant was that the British army was nearing the camp which was liberated on April 15, 1945. The British found 60,000 emaciated and starving prisoners. 14,000 died in the first five days following liberation, and another 14,000 perished during the weeks following.
        </li>

            Boegermoor was located in Lower Saxony, not too far from Hanover. It was one of the first concentration camps established in Nazi Germany. It was liberated on April 22, 1945. Those on the Barzilai's deportation train were freed by American troops before they reached Boegermoor.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_15"></a>
            These and other initial contacts which liberated concentration camp inmates had with the American army were most positive.

            Although Turkey had fought on the German side during World War I, it was neutral during World War II so those Jews with Turkish citizenship received some protection.

            In particular, the Jewish Committee for Social Action and Reconciliation was able to provide food and shelter for some 75% of the some 40,000 Holocaust survivors who came to France following their liberation.

            Greek Jewish losses as a result of the Holocaust were staggering and heartbreaking. Some 65,000 of the 75,000 Jews in Greece in 1939 were murdered. Mr. Barzilai's lists provide some indication of the awful death toll.

                Established in the spring of 1943 and initially intended as a transit camp, it soon was integrated into the concentration camp network.  Its population swelled late in the war as inmates from other camps further east were moved into it--from around 15,000 in late 1944 to 41,250 in March 1945.

            Nino Barzilai's native language was Ladino, which was spoken by many Sephardic Jews (Jews who originally came from Spain) who lived in the Balkans. Ladino contains elements of Spanish and Hebrew. Ladino's Spanish component enabled Nino Barzilai to speak Spanish in a fluent manner.

            Thessaloniki or Salonika was home to the most flourishing Sephardic Jewish community in the world before the Holocaust. Nearly all of its pre-war Jewish population of some 56,000 perished in the Holocaust, most of them in Auschwitz-Birkenau. The vibrant Sephardic Jewish community of Salonika, the heart of Sephardic world Jewry, was almost totally annihilated.

            The Spanish Civil War (1936-39) began with a military revolt led by General Francisco Franco against the republican government in Spain. The revolt was supported by conservative elements in the country. When the initial military coup failed to win control of the entire country,  bloody civil war ensued, which was fought with great ferocity on both sides. The nationalists-as the rebels were called-received aid from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The republicans received help from the Soviet Union as well as from the International Brigades, sympathetic volunteers who came from other European countries and the United States.

            The Italian army attacked Greece on October 28, 1940. The Greeks fought valiantly, and the war stalemated for a time. Even though the Spanish Civil War ended in 1939, Spain was a ravaged and devastated country.

            Mr. Barzilai and his family were among the thousands of Greek Jews who fled to Athens seeking sanctuary in the benevolent Italian zone of occupation. In 1941, the Athenian Jewish population was some 3,500. During the time of the Italian occupation (April, 1941-September, 1943), it rose to between eight thousand to ten thousand.

            The Germans invaded Greece on April 6, 1941 and by the end of the month, along with its Italian and Bulgarian allies, conquered the whole of the country. Athens, where the Barzilai's had fled, was in the Italian zone of occupation until Italy went over to the Allied side in September, 1943. On September 8, 1943, the Germans occupied Athens. From the outset, they instituted anti-Jewish such as the measures such as the confiscation of Jewish property, which resulted in the impoverishment of the community and plunged many Jews into destitution.

            Rabbi Barzilai courageously refused to cooperate with the Germans. He destroyed the Jewish communal lists they demanded and exhorted the Jews to flee. He escaped with the help of the Greek partisan network to the mountains of central Greece where he issued calls to the Western powers to aid the main Greek resistance group to save the Jews and fight the Germans. A number of Greek Jews were active in the resistance.

            Portugal and Spain remained neutral throughout World War II. Contrary to most Latin American countries, which declared war on Germany in 1941 and 1942 (after the United States had entered the war),  Argentina maintained a policy of neutrality during the war motivated by anti-American, anti-democratic and anti-communist sentiments among its ruling elite. It was not until March, 1945, two months before the German surrender, that Argentina declared  war on Nazi Germany.

            Bergen-Belsen was a Nazi concentration camp near Hanover, Germany, established in April, 1943. During the first eighteen months of the camp's existence, five satellite camps were established, one of which was the "neutral camp" in which Mr. Barzilai and his family were interned.

            What Mr. Barzilai meant was that the British army was nearing the camp which was liberated on April 15, 1945. The British found 60,000 emaciated and starving prisoners. 14,000 died in the first five days following liberation, and another 14,000 perished during the weeks following.

            Boegermoor was located in Lower Saxony, not too far from Hanover. It was one of the first concentration camps established in Nazi Germany. It was liberated on April 22, 1945. Those on the Barzilai's deportation train were freed by American troops before they reached Boegermoor.

            Greek Jewish losses as a result of the Holocaust were staggering and heartbreaking. Some 65,000 of the 75,000 Jews in Greece in 1939 were murdered. Mr. Barzilai's lists provide some indication of the awful death toll.
