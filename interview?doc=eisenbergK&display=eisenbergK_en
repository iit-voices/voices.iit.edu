Since our town was a manufacturing city with large factories, people were very scared. And a week's time, two weeks later when the German was already [there], we could not make a go of it in that small town so that we had to return to the [our] town. Soon during the journey we were stopped by Germans and searched. The little property [belongings] that we had was taken away from us on the road and distributed among the Poles, the Gentiles. And afterwards, when we came back to the town, we did not find anthing in the house any more. Everything had been taken out, and everything had been robbed by other neighbors. And in the town there were very few people. Soon on the next day, it was on 'Yom Kipper,' coming out next morning, the synagogue was already no more. We saw already it is in flames. That old synagogue that had been standing for years and years was lit up in flames. In the middle of the night, in the middle of the night on the second day, the synagogue was still burning. As propaganda, people had to take the rabbi and sign that the synagogue had been set on fire by ourselves. And we had to save [fight the fire] by ourselves. And who...and whoever came out to [try and] save the synagogue, they were beaten with terrible beatings, and also a few people were shot. And later on, when there had already passed a long, quite a long time, they were then...the Jews were then separated from the... from the Poles. The Jews had to live then in special houses on special streets where no Pole was allowed to enter. And soon there began very hard living conditions. And afterwards, after quite a long time, there was...there was...there was...issued an order from the German authorities that all Jews have to wear the bands. And [he] who does not have a band on his arm, he receives 'ten years' punishment, or else be shot [?] on the spot. Many cases happened when a Jew in that crowded <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a>, where he was living and could not sustain himself and his family, was forced to go out on the...on the forbidden streets. And many times it happened that Jews out of luck were shot, and half a year later an order came out that everyone from eighteen to forty-five has to report to the Jewish council...council. The next day at eight o'clock in the morning all the Jews in the town reported and [were] led out to a square, guarded by Germans, and there we stood without eating or drinking a whole day. In the evening, herded like cattle into RR-cars and shipped away. Many people, one may say...report that fifty per cent remained there in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>... </span>

And on the other streets where the Christians, the Gentiles, were living we could not go out on any more, and so it was very hard, that life. Returning home at night, sometimes I would find a potato without salt, and sometimes there was not even that. And early in the morning, again with the same hunger, return to the same work that a hundred per cent...fifty per cent, one can say, I did not expect to return, because [one was] without strength and getting beaten very much. All of a sudden Jews from all over begin to arrive in our town. There begins a traffic with autos, with trains. From all over Jews begin arriving. And so what is going on? There is a bustle in the town. People are being resettled. People are being resettled from all the towns to <a class="placename" href="#vothC112" type="camp">Treblinka</a> from where people do not return any more, the death <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> which is known all over the world, <a class="placename" href="#vothC112" type="camp">Treblinka</a>. We are thinking about a way out, but there is no way out. Thus it was going on for two weeks. One bright...bright morning a five o'clock, the whole town is guarded, surrounded, and an order was given that in ten minutes not one Jewish child [son or daughter of Israel] is to be found in his home. And many Jews...and many Jews were prepared for it. We slept with the clothes on. [He used the word Ungetuigs for clothes which was not understood by the interviewer.]</span>

There were already Germans waiting with grenades, with machine guns in the hands and looked for the moment to kill us. But we had...but we were following the order, and it did not last...did not take ten minutes to come out. Coming out on the street, I once more...I, myself, looked back once again at my house, and I said, 'This house I will not see again.' We went out to the market place. This is a large square in the center of town. All the Jews were assembled there. Walking, we already saw how Jewish blood flows in the streets, and the bullets are flying. When we were already assembled on the square, we see an old couple walking. They have no more strength to drag their feet. So a German takes and leads [them] into a house and with one bullet he shot both of them. Put one next to the other, both heads, and shot both. Going ahead, looking around the town again, we see the children lost from their mothers and mothers lost from their children. They are calling, the mothers to the children and the children to the mothers. But those children whom the Germans had noticed, who had from great fright lost their mothers, died immediately on the spot. Such a panic lasted four, five hours. It was terrible. Also while standing in rows, the Germans came over and took off immediately everything, the better things. I myself was dressed in my best suit, my best clothes. They soon took off my jacket and my boots, and they asked if I do not have any money or anything else.</span>

You are going with us. Whatever will happen to us will happen to you, too.' At a short distance passed an <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> man, and [he] immediately took off my jacket and a pair of boots. I remained barefooted. Luckily I had in my bundle a pair of old shoes that I had taken along. I put [them] on and stood dismayed, mornful, seeing what is happening to Jews. How the blood flows, and the little children taken by the feet and thrown against the wall. And later on when the afternoon came, everybody was tired standing on that square. There suddenly arrived an auto with five <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> men. And they said for all young men from eighteen to twenty-five to fall in, to be taken to work. I was a boy of fourteen years. I did not have the chance to step forward. But suddenly an <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> man was passing, and he took a liking to me. He gave me a sign with his revolver, and I had to step our from the ranks, and with a heavy...with an embittered heart I looked at the mother and left the ranks, [and was] incorporated into the ranks of the workers. Once more I wanted to turn and take a look at my mother. I soon got [it] with a riding crop over the head that to this day I still have a souvenir of that instant. </span>

We separately, and the women, very few, separately. When we where standing on that square an order came to hand over whatever we still had.

The night fell slowly. It fell gradually, and everybody on the plank beds, bewildered, confused, brooding. There was no question of sleeping. The desire to sleep came to nobody's mind. I, as a young boy, sit and cry and complain. With whon did I remain? And what will I do? And what will the future be? Lost. There is no hope. I myself must summon courage that I should be able to live through that moment and be able to relate to the Jews all over, in every corner or the world, in each of the four corners of the world, what has happened to the...to us. The story, the times we have gone through. In the middle of the night everyone sits exhausted, in thoughts. Suddenly we hear a shot.

And so gradually with our own efforts we did whatever we could in order to alleviate their suffering, to reduce their plight. Dawn was nearing slowly. We all arose, and we wanted to go to work. We thought that if we remain lying they will take it for sabotage, that we do not want to go to work. So we all arose and went to work.

The guards [authorities] of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> made him so temporarily. And he came in...he came into the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>, and he told us to get dressed and go to work. In five minutes everybody was ready, because nobody had slept, nobody had undressed. Everybody was depressed, crush-...crushed by his...by his misfortunes, by his pain. [We were] arranged on the square and went to work Going out through the gate we received the bread which we took along among our things. Everyone received a slice of around ten dekas, five dekas. It depended on how much luck one had. And a little bitter, cold, unsweetened coffee. That was the first day of our going out to work. When we arrived at work...[when we were] entering the factory, the Ukrainians received us with bad beatings [?]. We were assigned to sections in Polish, 'Do wydzial' [to work halls] where everyone was to work. We immediately got the worst kind of work. We, Jews children, were taken,of eighteen, or seventeen, of sixteen years, [and] assigned to ovens of two thousand degrees of heat. They made ammunition, cannon...shells for cannon. And who did not complete the 'norm' like one says in Polish, that means the number that he was supposed to make--that was two thousand to three thousand shells--had to stand sixteen hours. And if I did not finish in sixteen hours, he [I?] Had to remain for twenty-four hours. That is how it was going on every day, the day by day work. In a short time very, very many people had fallen who did not have the strength to endure all those things. When the...when the Russians had come closer, [when] they came near the Vistula, the Germans considered it a danger if we should remain in the place, and we have to be sent away to [the interior of] Germany. At night there came an order that not one Jew is to go to work but has to remain in the place, on that spot, in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. A terrible fright gripped the whole lager. Everybody walked around brooding and said, 'Now [these] are our last moments. The Russians are approaching and the Germans knows that he has lost the war. He will finish us all off on the spot just where we are.' Two three...two days this situation [?] lasted.</span>

The section which is working from seven in the morning till three in the afternoon can still go to work. It became a little easier, but still people were still going around with the same fright. [The continuity seems disrupted.] Arriving at work, the Gentiles, the Christians, told us the terrible agony that was experienced by the people who had remained there on the square. Because until now we had had no information, and later on we had some information from people who had returned...who were taken as far as <a class="placename" href="#vothC112" type="camp">Treblinka</a> and after that they returned. And part of those people [possibly Christians] were also working there in the factory, who were driving the wagons, the engines from on factory to another. An acquaintance, a Jew, was acquainted with such a machinist, and he told him about the terrible tortures that the Jews, those people had suffered, who had been taken away. First of all, a hundred and fifty people were packed into a small RR-car. Entirely closed, nailed shut, doused with chloride [chlorek]. And the bundles taken away, and the water they needed. And chased inside [the RR-cars], beaten up, grabbed bloody, herded into the RR-cars. That Christian reported the impossible thing that fifty per cent would arrive half alive at that place. He said that he is completely convinced that not a single Jew will [could] arrive at that place alive, not withstanding that the place as such was the death sentence. That means <a class="placename" href="#vothC112" type="camp">Treblinka</a>. Returning from work, we heard that the guards had searched the entire plant [to see] whether, God forbid, a Jew did not hide himself there and escape at night into the forest and hide himself. </span>

Should we remain till next morning there are definite rumors that we will be shot. At night everyone was awake. No one slept. The police [apparently Jewish <a class="term" href="#vothG_trusty">trusties</a>] came into each barrack and said 'Jews, the last moments of our lives are approaching, and so we have one way out, to break out of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. And not far from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> there is a forest. It is quite certain that many Jews will fall but this cannot be helped.

At night, everything ready, a little bundle in the hand, with hammers, with pliers, with axes, [we] went over to the...eh...went over to the wires. There was no strong guard. And so on all four side Jews were standing and watched for the moment to be able to go over, tear out the fence and escape into the forest. Thus it lasted four, five, ten minutes. After that there came people running from all four sides and breaking the boards and cutting the wires. And a few people running from all four sides and breaking the boards and cutting the wires. And a few people succeeded in escaping. At the same moment fire began falling from all four roofs, from the towers where the guards stood, and many, many were shot and a very small part escaped into the woods. But the majority of Jews were afraid to risk [it] and did not have the possibilities any more of running over to the fence and running away, because death awaited them immediately.</span>

And on the road fifty per cent of the people died, frozen from the cold, of hunger, and of thirst. When someone died -- it was very crowed -- he was simply taken and thrown down the hills and valleys, wherever the place of his death happened to be, and covered with snow. And many people 'don't even know' where their bones have come to be [affective distortion of linguistic structure].

Inside the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> the names of the Jews were immediately called out, and we were put to the side.

There were many days in which we received twenty dekas of moldy bread and a little water -- this was the soup, made out of water and leaves, nothing else. But we succeeded in living through the time.

And around every group of fifty there stood twenty <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> men with dogs. And to move two meters away from the group was punishable by death. After three days they brought a few liters of water, called out everybody's name, and measured out a spoonful of water. And this was the food supply...the food...the food supply [Verpflegung], as it is called in German, for three days. And for the other two days we lay in the rain.

But this could not go on for long, because many people fell. Fell. Simply fell. And every meter there were corpses lying on both sides [of the road].

When the...when the Americans were already very close, the Germans were chasing us faster and faster. But we did not want to walk. There was an air-raid alarm, and they ran into the forest. Then I and another three comrades from my town ran to the other side of the forest and hid ourselves. The German looked for us and could not find us. After having been in the forest two, three hours, we saw a village burning, and nearby there stands a tank with the lettering 'U.S.A.' We knew that U.S,A. stands for American. We also saw the star. But we did not believe that we would live to see the happy moment of liberation. Walking out a little farther, we see oncoming tanks, Americans. The first thing when we went over to the tank, there was a man with gun in hand. And he asked us who we are. He saw at once that we are...</span>
