Greater credence could be given to the stories of mass executions which nearly always carried the assertion that the machine gunned or gassed victims were not all completely dead at the moment of burial or cremation.] . . .</span>

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
