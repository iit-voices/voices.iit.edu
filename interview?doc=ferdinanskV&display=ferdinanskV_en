            Boder is referring to Michael von Faulhaber, a Roman Catholic Cardinal and Archbishop of Munich from 1917 to 1952. Faulhaber was an outspoken ideological opponent of the violent and racist policies of the Nazis. He was involved in Reichskonkordat negotiations of 1933, an agreement between the Holy See and the Nazi government that guaranteed Catholics freedom of religion in Germany. Although on the surface, this agreement appeared to sanction the activities of the Nazis, but in fact most Catholic leaders remained fundamentally opposed to Hitler's rule.

            Boder is referring to Michael von Faulhaber, a Roman Catholic Cardinal and Archbishop of Munich from 1917 to 1952. Faulhaber was an outspoken ideological opponent of the violent and racist policies of the Nazis. He was involved in Reichskonkordat negotiations of 1933, an agreement between the Holy See and the Nazi government that guaranteed Catholics freedom of religion in Germany. Although on the surface, this agreement appeared to sanction the activities of the Nazis, but in fact most Catholic leaders remained fundamentally opposed to Hitler's rule.
