            <span class="utterance" who="#paulA" start="753.661" end="x">Yes. I was in charge of a Russian school. Now about the textbooks. The textbooks were all changed over to Soviet textbooks. They were brought over from there. There was a <a class="placename" href="#vothL361">Moscow</a> publishing house and a <a class="placename" href="#vothL453">Leningrad</a> publishing house. Now, I want to state that our textbooks were excellent. They were published in Estonia. Of course some of them were published by the Russians. Some were from Estonian publishers. The material was of considerable variety and it was interesting. And now about the textbooks. The children, the more intelligent ones, used to say, "What a bore!" That is what the children would say because in the readers, in the Russian readers, besides all the variations of biographies of Lenin, there was practically nothing, save the story of a Chinaman weeping on the occasion of his death. There was nothing else. Propaganda, and solely propaganda. Now about the texts in arithmetic. All the problems were about Kolkhosy. [Collective farms organized by the Soviet government.] About Kolkhos sheep or Kolkhos cows and so on, and so on. It was all very boresome and very onesided. Attention was directed not towards education but solely toward propaganda. Exclusively towards propaganda. Now let me tell you another interesting thing. I have read . . . and never had I read so much as during the time the Communists were with us because . . . here is what I was thinking: "For twenty-five years people have lived with the communist government. Well people live. So we too should be able to adjust ourselfs in some way." I wanted to know what was the matter. Maybe I have the wrong viewpoint. Maybe I am mistaken. I am a person of definite views. You see at school we had to install . . . we had to change entirely the library for the teachers. I bought an awful lot of books. I bought a large quantity of books for the children's library. We teachers had to pass examinations on the history of the party. But the more I studied communism [here the recording is not clear, but it seems that it sounds like "darker became my outlook"]. The more I felt that I was getting suffocated. I remember the following incident. One of my friends, she was the director of Gitznek. This was an organization for the self-defense of women. And knowing . . . raids had already started . . . that she will be arrested, [she was a very nervous person] she committed suicide. She took poison. Now the idea of the inviolability of the home, that was just an empty word. They used to come into my house and without asking whether they may enter a room, whether they may not enter a room. They ordered me to remove the icon; to take it off the wall. I tell them . . . well they say, "Do parents come to see you?" I say "yes, parents do come." I was on very good terms with the parents. I worked in that school for eighteen years and I was on very good terms with my whole district . . . "So parents are coming to see you"â"Yes, they do come."â"Well if they will see that there is an icon on your wall you will lose prestige in their eyes, and it will also be a bad example for the parents and the children."â"Well," I told them, "in my 'official office' as a teacherâmy apartment was upstairs,âI had to take off all the icons." By the way, all the children and the whole population, even the Lutheran population of the regionâall received this order with tears in their eyes, that I must tell you.</span>

Because even those who understood well the plans of the Germans, felt that by their advent they would save us from Communism. People saw that the evil that the Germans would bring us would be the lesser evil in comparison with what the communists brought over our country. Let me tell you about the time they started to build their bases. They literally robbed our whole country because they would buy, they would buy by the dozen and a half men's shirts, they would buy . . . you see we had free trade when they came. Their ladies would buy, their military ladies would buy underwear by the dozen. By the way, I have to tell you, they had literally nothing, because one of the seamstresses who worked for me for several years, the owner of the shop, told me that. Ladies would come and would ask her to go with them shopping because they did not know the names of our yard goods. [Of course the Russian women did not speak Estonian and therefore could have been in need of an interpreter. What Mrs. P. apparently implies is that the Estonian shopkeepers spoke Russian, but that the Russian women "never having seen at home good dress material" were unable to ask for the goods by name. ] They were not acquainted with our dress patterns. Let me tell you that, as a fact, they would pick up candy wrappings and wrappings from chocolate because they had not seen such paper. They would ask us: "Do you really use such paper for wrapping? How do you wrap? We have to take with us a piece of newspaper because we just don't have any wrapping paper." They were marvelling at everything. They would marvel that one could buy a half a kilo of sausage at the time because [at home] the could buy only by the gram.</span>

They would not show consideration for anything. In some places there would be a dead body. People would plead: "Let us at least bury him," In a family of two of my friends there were two children. The husband was arrested before. He was superintendent of a Gymnasium. [long pause] The child had pneumonia, his temperature was 40 [centigrade]. The child was left in his bed, the family sent to the railroad station. And then the transport was standing there two, three days. [The heat happened to be intolerable those days.] People could not get any water. Afterwards a friend, a doctor told me, he had to examine the transport, and after going a over few cars, he fainted; he, a man, a doctor, after seeing these sights.

That is what I was told by a laborer who worked that time on the railroad station. So you see the second echelon simply didn't materialize because the war put a halt to it. The civil servants were evacuated, and the armies were in retreat. Now let me tell you about the retreat of the army. They were surrounded. You can imagine. Pskov, Ostrov, they were already taken by the Germans. The Germans managed to by-pass them. Part of the Soviet armies remained behind. These armies marched without their commanding complements. They marched alone. They marched barefooted; many had no soles on their boots.</span>

It was very hot that time. They called them Mayka [apparently from the month of May, meaning summer shirts], and they begged; "Take my Mayka and give me a piece of bread." That is how the armies retreated. Many of them remained in Estonia. Many remained in Estonia and hired themselves out to the peasants. It was the time of bringing in the hay . . . and only for bread, only to be satiated for the first time after several years. "I will work for you," he said, "like an ox," helping the peasant to cut down the hay, only to have a bellyful. And they would tell us a lot. They would tell us that they were awakening to life again, seeing the conditions of our Estonian peasants, seeing how our Estonian peasants lived. Then they would tell us about the life in the Kolkhos. One of them was a plain laborer. That is, he was a peasant, a farmer at home in his fatherland. He told us about the following occurrence in their Kolkhos. In that Kolkhos his son got as a homework assignment the following problem: to find out exactly how many working days there were in a certain period of time, what did they earn, and how much that would come to per day. The boy asked his mother for exact information. When the mother supplied him with the dataâthat is, how much they got for one working dayâand the child presented it at school the mother was arrested because she was supposed to have given the child the kind of data somebody needed her to give, and not the correct data.</span>

Later they were driven by hunger out of the forests. I had the opportunity to talk to them. They would ask where they could go, how they could get away safely, because if their government should find out that they were here, surrounded, without making any attempts to fight their way through, their families would be shot. One of them was a young fellow. He said, "I have a wife; I have three children; and they will all perish if they should find out that I am a prisoner, that I am surrounded, and that I am not making any attempt to get away." So I started telling him:â"What are you going to fight for, what are you going to fight for?" And he would say: "We are liberators; we are liberating Europe from a regime of horror."</span>

We have lived a quiet peaceful life, and now after you have been here a year, we are living in a devestated country and we have only widows and orphans. Such is our life." And you know, after my talk with him he lived for some time in the vicinity and did not go anywhere. He said afterwards: "Indeed, there is nowhere to go; indeed there is nothing to fight a war for." He saw the books; Russian literature was permitted in our country. Soviet literature was free in our country. I couldn't say that everything was free, not all the literature, but many literary works were permitted. They were in our library. But at home they would read only communistic literature and you know how a Soviet person is being brought up. From the earliest childhood; I told you already what kind of textbooks they had.</span>

Now a German military unit was assigned to the school. Well, there arrived some people of authority in a car. It was yet before the start of classes. School was supposed to start by the end of September and at the beginning of September I was told that by the eighth or ninth of September my school will be occupied by the German military. I only asked how much time I will be given because I had to look for other quarters. They told me two, three days should be enough. I told them, that would be a little insufficient because I had to travel through the district, and find means to transfer the school and all its property. Well they allowed me three or four days. They gave me facilities to get to the regional authorities. They assigned to me twenty horses with carts, and I went to look for quarters to distribute my classes. I also asked them about my personal quarters; would I have to look for new quarters or would they leave me my apartment? Well, they told me that my personal quarters would remain intact and I would remain in my apartment until the end. Afterwards when their contingent increased I ceded to them a room in my apartment and reduced, so to speak, myself to less. Still my apartment remained intact.</span>

They did not interfere with the school whatsoever. They absolutely did not interfere with the school. They readily talked about their own schools. They were marvelling very much at our long vacations in Estonia. They told me that in Germany they had no summer vacations at all, maybe only for a week or two. [At this point of the interview we hear on the wire a violent whistle; it seems to be the noon whistle]. I, as a teacher, was interested in what the peasant children were doing. Our children help their parents in the summer. They told me that their laws are so strict that the parents have already adjusted themselves to them, to the fact that the children go to school all summer. They also told me . . . as a teacher I was very much interested in the situation of the schools in Germany. I myself had never been in Germany. I knew about it only from the literature like about the schools all over Europe. But I never heard any personal reports about them.
