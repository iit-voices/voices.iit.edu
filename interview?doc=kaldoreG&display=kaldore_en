They would take us into a bunder or maybe into an open field, so that we should not be standing at the railroad station. But they did not take us to an open field. Within two minutes from there, in a sugar factory, there was the <a class="placename" href="#vothC155" type="camp">Ghetto</a>, a small <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a>, a small <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> where the Jews of the city lives.

We did so. We didn't know yet what would happen to us afterwards. The <a class="term" href="#vothG_gendarme">gendarmerie</a> came and searched our pockets for things we still might have had in them. We had nothing. We were afraid. We knew that if we did not give them up we would get a bad beating. We surrendered everything, and they took it for themselves. We saw ourselves that they put it in their own pockets. After we had surrendered our things, the Hungarian officer told us in Hungarian, and then came a German officer who really wasn't a "German" officer but a Hungarian officer [in German uniform], the famous captain Zöldy. Captain Zöldy, who ordered the <a class="term" href="#vothG_pogrom">pogroms</a> in <a class="placename" href="#vothL527">Novi Sad</a> of which the whole world has been talking.

There were a total of two or three thousand people. At 12:00 we got into the railroad cars. Soon the cars were sealed, and first of all one was named commander of the car. And they didn't give us any water or nothing. The Hungarian <a class="term" href="#vothG_gendarme">gendarmerie</a> with the police stood next to the cars. And they walked with their guns and nobody could get out from the inside the cars. Nobody could do that. We just had to sit inside. And we sat there, and were thinking where they would take us. One said they would take us to Austria; another said they would take us somewhere in Hungary, or they would take us to the German labor service. But we, the Hungarian Jews, and the Jews who didn't know anything about <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>--they had not heard over the radio about <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>, and when there would come Polish Jews or German Jews [and tell us about it] they would say, 'No, that is impossible. It is not possible that they are burning German and Polish Jews in <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>.' We did not belevee that.</span>

And before we entered the washroom out on the street there was music. We heard music. There were prisoners who played trumpets. A whole musical orchestra. They played jazz music. So we aked what was going on. 'Yes,' they told us, 'there comes a new transport, and they play so that on shouldn't suspect anything.' And the men tell us we shouldn't ask so many questions.' And we see people running and asking, 'Jews, where are you from?' And Hungarians ask in Hungarian. And the only drink we ask is, 'Jews, can one drink the water here?' 'Yes, you may drink, but don't drink too much.' We enter the washroom and there already is the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> with the Polish <a class="term" href="#vothG_capo">capo</a>, that is, the Polish non-Jewish <a class="term" href="#vothG_capo">capo</a>, and they order us, 'Jews, take off everything; you will get entirely new clothes. Take off everything, and leave it here. Completely naked, you are to take only your shoes and the belt for your trousers.' And then we went ahead into the second room. And we entered then the second room, where there were sitting on long bench Jews, Polish Jews, who had in their hands hair clippers. They shaved us entirely; that is, wherever we had hair, it was completely shorn off with clippers. The hair from our heads, our beards, and then we proceeded to the next door. At that door there was standing a <a class="term" href="#vothG_capo">capo</a> who looked into our mouth to see whether we had anything in our mouth -- anything hidden there, guldens, or diamonds, or such other things of value.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="#kaldoreG" start="2374.632" end="x">Oh, yes, the x-ray lamp. I will tell you how it was. He brought also pliers and hammers, and he ordered that we should tear off the soles from our shoes. 'Maybe you have hidden away there something, and we may not have noticed it when you came into the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>.' And he came around, and the Jews took off the soles and there still appeared gold, and there still appeared money. And one Jew pulled out a work book--a German work book. He said, 'This is my work book. I am a working man and I shall work.' And he said, 'Just drop it here.' Our pictures of the mother, of the father, that we had managed to save, I don't know how, in the shoes, they just had managed to hide them in the shoes or wherever--I can't describe it. I really cannot imagine how they hid them after such a thorough search. And then he said, 'Has everything been surrendered?' And the Jews said, 'Yes.' Then he said, 'Yes, I see you are Hungarian Jews. You haven't anything on you. You are the kind that are afraid. Hungarian Jews are all afraid. I shall not search you with the x-ray lamp.' Later we learned that it was no x-ray lamp. It was a plain ordinary large lamp that he brought in. And he took the guldens, and two days later we learned that with the guldens he had bought from the Polish workers who worked in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, who did not live in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> but just came there to work, and from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> soldiers, he bought bread and bought fat and ate it.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="#kaldoreG" start="2491.127" end="x">No, he was getting just his ration. He only had food that he could steal from the jews. And he said, 'Soon they will bring here black coffee. Everybody will get the coffee.' And sure, they brought the coffee, and he said, 'Jews, you are not permitted to leave this place. You may step out two paces. There is a box inside the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> for you small needs, and outside the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> two paces away is another box, where you can satisfy your big needs.

If one takes three paces, they grab him and shoot him immediately.' And we again lay down on the ground, without blankets, without anything, and we slept. That was the first night, after the railroad cars, that we could sleep a bit. In the morning at six there was a bell to ger up for <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">Appell</a>. We stepped out. We were counted up [to ascertain] how many people we were. Then we were told that now we had to clean the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>.

            <span class="utterance" who="#kaldoreG" start="2584.644" end="x">Brooms and mops, yes. And to clean up. At ten they brought the first soup. That was a German soup in which they threw together everything possible. It was served for ten people together in a large pot. The pot was dirty. It was a pot that was taken out from the railroad cars where the Jews were, without washing them out. We knew what these pots had been used for. The Jews had "done" into them while in the cars. And we had no water to wash them out. A few people would not eat. I said, 'I shall eat what they give me.' That is, [although] it is impossible to eat it. One cannot eat it [but] I, too, [for my part] shall eat it, because I know that if I don't eat I won't have the strength to go on with the work. And there were two people, diabetics, who became so ill that they said, 'We need injections.' And they were led away. They were led away, and we haven't seen them any more. By eleven--we already dared to make a few steps outside--we saw something burning. It burns, it burns, it burns. In the morning at eleven we saw flames, and a stenchy smell. We asked the Gypsies, 'What are they burning?' So they say, 'They are burning the clothes that you brought with you, rags, since it cannot be used. It is none of your worry what is burning.' And afterwards they told us, 'now go and lie down again.' We did nothing. Another day passed. A day later came an <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a>. We were told to get up. The <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> looked at us, looked us over, and ordered those who were once soldiers to step forward, who were soldiers before the war, those who are strong people, for hard work. And they stepped forward. They divided us into two groups: the strong people and the not very strong people.</span>

Such a fight that the one who is stronger will go on the side with the strong people, and the other one will go on the other side.' And so we--the one got to one side. And the Jews even laughed about it. What did they know about what was going to happen? And those men, the strong men who were lined up, there were 500 of us.</span>

Some months later I met one of them in a work camp where he was assigned afterwards. And he told me they were taken to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a> to work in a factory. They went to the so-called quarantine <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, that is, <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">Block</a> I in <a class="placename" href="#vothC10" type="camp">Birkenau</a>. In the quarantine <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> they were given one blanket for three people, and there were single-level beds; that is, in one bed there slept ten people. They were not really beds, they were simply knocked together of wood, plank beds. And ten people slept with five blankets. And by that time we were approached by the Jews, the Polish Jews, who wanted already to barter with us for our shoes. One wanted to give a piece of bread with other shoes. And they told us that the shoes here amount to life. The one who has shoes lives, here. And we didn't want to barter. We were taken to quarantine, because there was scarlet fever in the Gypsy <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. And we were in the quarantine <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> four days. Afterwards there came an order after the <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">Appell</a> that all of us have to move on. So these five hundred men marched in formation, four abrest, holding each other's shoulder, four people all the way. And with us marched ten <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> men with guns in hand and led us through <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>, through the streets. We saw the people, we saw stores, people walking the streets, the Poles, the Christians. There were some that looked at us with sadness. There were some that laughed at us. And we marched away 10 kilometers. We entered a camp which was called the <a class="placename" href="#vothC18" type="camp">Buna</a> <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. That belonged to the I.G. Farben Industry, the big company of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, a big plant of synthetic rubber, <a class="placename" href="#vothC18" type="camp">Buna</a>. We marched in there. The <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> leader soon lined us up at the <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">Appell</a> square and said, 'You get ready to go into the washroom.' And again we were led into the disinfection chambers. Again they took away the clothes which we have gotten before. We went into the chambers. We are being disinfected again. We came out to the "clean" side again. There was standing a doctor who examined us, and we were given very bad things, again these blue-white striped things, but in very bad condition, torn ones of small sizes, and we were led again into a <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>, the quarantine <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> and they told us, 'Men, you shall remain here, and you are not permitted to leave the quarantine <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> until you will be assigned to commandos [to squads] in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>; ' because we had come from a <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> where there was scarlet fever. And for what ever reason we don't know, we were assigned to the punishment detail; that is, it was called an outside detail which worked outside the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> six kilometers away.

That is in 50 litre barrels. Two people had to carry it on the road barefooted, the hot food. And after every two or three hundred men again two people were carrying a barrel. Those who carried the barrel barefooted had to run at the same pace as the others did. They were not permitted to fall behind the group. And we went out there and worded there.

From four in the morning when we were getting up, everybody had to wash in the washroom, and then there was breakfast. At breakfast we were given 300 grams of bread with 20 grams of margarine, not the synthetic margarine that did not contain fat. The German margarine. And that was all the breakfast.</span>

At twelve we went to eat. The food consisted of a half a liter of soup. The soup was a half a liter of water. That's what it was. Green leaves cooked in that warm water. And from twelve to one we were free and we would lie down on the grass and sleep a bit. At one we would return to work and work until five. Later on, when the time, when the weather got darker, we didn't work so late anymore. We always worked as long as it was light. At dusk we would get back with the details into the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. We would assemble at the <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">Appell</a> square, and at the <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">Appell</a> square we were counted again. We had already been counted at the entrance but we were counted again on the <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">Appell</a> square. And after the count we went to wash. Everybody had to wash, and after washing we would get the evening meal. The evening meal was three/fourths of a liter of soup, three/fourths of a liter of soup. This soup was a little heavier, not so thin, and it had some potatoes, or turnips cooked in it. The turnips that used to be served in Hungary to cattle, those red turnips and white turnips. And after eating, once a week we had to shave. The hair was clipped down completely with a zero clipper and every week we were shaved. They used two knives to shave two, three hundred men without sharpening the knife. Each shave was [a surgical] operation. And the people would get the so-called beard eruptions, infections, and because of the infection one would look terribly ugly. And people with such infections were not shaved anymore, so that these people would walk around with month-old beards, with six-weeks-old beards, two-months-old beards, and they looked very very ugly. After that we would lie down and sleep. It was a very bitter life. We had two-deck beds. There were two blankets on each bed and nothing else. Two people slept on each cot, one with his head at the other fellow's feet, and the other one on the other side. The cots were approximately 50 cms. wide. These beds are full of bedbugs, full of vermin, fleas, and bedbugs.</span>

Only drinking it from the bowl. That was on Christmas day. They believed that on Christmas, on Christmas we would get some additional rations, Christmas, the great holiday of the Christians, but we got nothing, no additional rations. I was lying there until the third of January. The first of January was my birthday. I went to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>

The other people saw that, and they said, 'I too have a birthday.' They said it on the next day, and also approached him. But he had the card indexes of us and so he would say, 'Good, you get food, but if it is not your birthday, you will be killed.' And I saw him beating a sick person with a whip.</span>

We see that something was in the offing. That liberty is coming for us, and we walked away from the bunker. We entered the first village. We went into [the house of] a Polish peasant, and we told the Polish peasant to let us come in. He could see that the Germans are running away and that the Russians are coming. He took us into his house and gave us a bit to eat. He himself did not have much. For two days we were hiding with this peasant, and at night the Russians arrive. When the Russians arrived we ourselves went back to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> and in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> people were rejoicing. But of the four hundred people there remained only about two hundred people. The others had died from starvation, had died from typhus which started to ravage there, and we had nothing on our bodies. We had already long beards, three--four weeks old, and there were these <a class="term" href="#vothG_mussulman">musselmen</a> who had only bones and flesh--flesh, do I say?

So he said, 'Where are you from?' We said, 'We are Hungarians.' So he said, 'You should go to <a class="placename" href="#vothL135">Krakow</a>, and from <a class="placename" href="#vothL135">Krakow</a> the trains are already running and you can go home already.' That was the twenty-fifth of January in 1945. And soon we marched on. We took two other comrades and, with my comrade, the four of us marched on foot. <a class="placename" href="#vothL135">Krakow</a> was 60 kilometers away and I, with my foot that still had pus, we marched on, on foot.

They gathered us all together and transported us to <a class="placename" href="#vothL135">Krakow</a>. In frakow there were already a lot of people, liberated people assembled in a large place, what do they call it? An armory. The Russians fed us there.

Who wanted to become a soldier and enter the Russian Army? I saw things wouldn't be good there. It was already very dirty, there were already lice. And I and my comrades went to town and looked for the Red Cross. We found there the Red Cross. The International Red Cross. We went in. I knew French and my comrade also spoke French well, and we told a little lie. We told the Polish physician, since he is a physician and I am a physician, too, and now we have come from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, we are very weak.

                    The German term meaning “Muslim.” The term applied to prisoners in camps close to dying from starvation and exhaustion. Their skeletal faces were devoid of expression, and they seemed to have been overcome by despair and by the absence of the will to live. The origin of the term has not been definitively established, though it has been attributed to a certain similarity to a prostrate Muslim in prayer.
