When they said "political case" light darkened in my eyes because I had on me letters from various socialist friends who were then in prison. And I said of course that I don't have anything to do with the politics. Nonetheless they asked us to take clothing and food for several days. "What to do with the child?"

He was brought to [unclear] <a class="placename" href="#vothC27" type="camp">Drancy</a>, when he was working on rails dismantling a bomb which supposedly didn't explode. German left to the other side. Then, without waiting for the German to return, he ran away. And three weeks later he appeared in <a class="placename" href="#vothL458">Voiron</a>. By the joined effort he was sent to the Spanish border. He crossed into Spain and was sent to Palestine. And remained there. But the rest of them perished. From all of them only one person returned—young man 19 year old. [Pause] Well, rabbi was hiding all the time. And somewhat later I was returning after a visit with him and met two friends of mine. They told me: "Listen, what awful news! What tragedy! Schmierson is killed." At first I didn't dare to tell them that I was returning after visiting with him as everything was kept under a big secret, even from the closest friends. Especially because that day I brought him a big sum of money. He still had visitors, religious Jews who were hiding among Résistance and lived without any money and whom he financially supported. So I said: "What happened? Tell me how?" "In [says the name of the place in French, unclear]—it's 6km away from <a class="placename" href="#vothL458">Voiron</a>—Schmierson was killed." And you know they started to cry. I said: "Listen, girls. Schmierson is not killed. I am returning from seeing him. When was he killed?" "1,5 hrs. ago." "unclear] 1,5hrs as well—these are impossible things in the end. If they were there it means that they would have found me as well. And I wouldn't be sitting right now at the tea table." What happened was that they arrived [unclear] and asked a girl: "Tell us, do you know here a gentleman with a beard?" And the girl really said: "But of course! Here, he lives in this little house." And they went—militia—there. It was a little house where two Jews lived. They built a fake wall in their house. Behind that wall there was a hole where two people could fit. Son-in-law of this gentleman hid there and said: "Come with me, father." But the father said: "No. If it's my destiny to live—I'll live, if not, I am",—he says—"God's son." And they entered. And they took these Jews. Two. The second one came to visit and discuss some religious but maybe also political topics. And in three hours they found [unclear].</span>

"Mr. Levy?! But of course, Mr. Levy resides at a castle." Did he live in a castle? No. Because it was a castle . . . because it was a very cheap . . . his acquaintances gave him a room in one so called castle. It was a big house in the middle of the orchard. And so. Editor of this newspaper, Mr. Jordal took part in arrests and robbery of all Jews who could be found in the surroundings of <a class="placename" href="#vothL339">Grenoble</a>, and who assisted in arrest of the wife of rabbi Schmierson. And so, one beautiful morning . . . his house was just across the street form the state professional school. Boys from the school were, of course, members of the Résistance. And so, one beautiful morning, at 7 in the morning I went to town and one woman tells me: "Madam, why?! You are in town?! Do you know that Jordal got killed?" I got quite an unpleasant feeling. She says: "Yes, he is killed. I beg you please be careful because there could be a big problem." I went home. This was a very difficult time in France. We absolutely didn't have any bread. But because I had a little family who I had to feed I decided what comes comes but I had to find some bread. And I went to town. I met a policeman I knew: "Where do you go?"

Besides he had a machine gun. And I left. And when I met several familiar Jews on the street I told them: "Gentlemen, go home. It smells bad today." Unfortunately, not all of them listened to me. I came home. And in two hours I have learned that at the square they took 7 Jews, and that they were taken away. It was at 2 o'clock. At 6 in the evening a young man from the Résistance came to see me and said: "Madam, seven people are killed behind the mill." They were killed in most horrifying manner. They had eyes torn out. Their nails were torn out. They had every hair pulled out separately. Their members were cut and all [unclear, noises]. They tortured them in the most atrocious way. We didn't have time to cry.

Merry, loved to drink, father of seven children and a man who didn't fear anything at all. And what I am about to tell you saw my girlfriend with her own eyes from the windows of her hotel. She lives as a peasant in this village, was a singer, called [says the name of the theater in French]. A car arrived with two <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> and two militia men in it. They approached the Pole who was sitting with some other Poles at the table drinking beer. They asked them to undress. At first everybody was shocked. They say: "Are you Jews?" "No." "Then undress." They undressed, proved that they are not Jews. And this Pole was somewhat flustered. And he raised his hand on <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a>  Ah! "Good bye, good bye!" The latter, first of all, noticed a Polish hand: "How is that possible! Pole raised his hand! And this "Good bye"!" He grabbed this Pole by the collar, pushed him into the car and took him away. Three days later his body was found. I have to say that this little town was at its best. His wife [unclear] but he cannot be brought back of course. That he was the most unlucky guy. The town accommodated her greatly. She immediately received 20 thousand francs. When she gave birth to their 4th child she was placed into the municipal hospital—the hospital there is amazing, by the way,—and its head physician, Dr. Bova was at his best. Among others he treated members of the Resistance, performed surgeries and all. They didn't take money from her, of course. She received a wonderful town's dowry for her baby. I mentioned that I need a couple of baby suits and one French lady—she also worked at the Resistance—brought me a box of things which you couldn't get even for the biggest money. As you know everything was limited and children received 3kg of wool for the first three years of life while normally 5kg were needed [unclear]. She was given a certain pension by the Jewish organizations, by the Resistance. But in the end it doesn't bring her husband back especially while they were very close to each other. So and about this time when militia was at the height of its power my grandmother came to <a class="placename" href="#vothL458">Voiron</a> with the French papers.

Those who managed to escape the fascists Spain during the war were interned here, in the south of France in various camps. And then they all together were sent [away]. And so one of them—this happened at the train station with . . . hmm . . . at the receiving station in <a class="placename" href="#vothL261">Toulouse</a>—he took off his shirt, took off his pants and showed me his body. On his chest there was a scar three fingers wide and one and a half finger deep. Here he was hit by a shovel. On his back there was a hole in which one could place a little finger, it stretched to the ribs. Here he was hit by a pick. He had 12 gunshot wounds, or more—I don't even know. He didn't have any live place on his body. And this happened because as a communist he was at a camp where there were prisoners [unclear]—and there he was hit by a shovel, pick, machine gun and anything else you want. He miraculously survived. I was told about a woman who was deported and who survived. She survived in the following way: She was first pushed into a gas chamber, the rest was pushed behind her. She fell down when the gas started. And other dead bodies covered her. And when they started to clean up she was unconscious but alive. This woman is here now.<note n="48"><span class="note">There is one recorded incident of such an occurrence in an Auschwitz gas chamber. However, the young woman who survived the gas was shot soon after.</span><sup><a href="#note_48">48</a></sup></note> There the most unusual things happened. So I was talk about a woman—she was from <a class="placename" href="#vothL261">Toulouse</a> [unclear]. She was taken away with an 8 month old baby. She came back with the 17 months old baby. How she manages to save him even she doesn't understand. She kept him in the garbage, under her skirt and she fed him anything you want. She fed him this horrible pardon my language soup. It was water, dishwater with several leaves in it. Some boys told me that one of them and to take care of the dogs. You know there were those special trained dogs. And one of these dogs almost dies of hunger when she ate that soup. He gave her his soup. I talked to a young man. His fake name was Jeber. [Unclear] "I don't want to [unclear] with the dogs." "Such a nice little dog." He said: "I can't see any dogs." I asked: "Why?" He said: "After I saw with my own eyes how a dog tore apart two children and you want that I'll ever again touch a dog?!" I told him: "[Unclear] specially trained dogs!" And he: "It doesn't matter. However long the dog is trained . . . " I told him: "So you can't look at the people as well? [Unclear]" But he said: "People—[unclear]." [Lengthy pause] But those who came back here . . . I'll tell you that all of them are mutilated for life. A manager of an orphanage in [unclear] told me that at night they have nightmares.</span>

Suddenly they don't want to do something. Once I came to the orphanage to ask for a little athletic [unclear]. So I came to them and asked them to do a little performance for our students. I told them: "Gentlemen, on Saturday we have a little concert. You are our dear guests. I would truly appreciate it if you could recite some poem for us, dance for us." "No, we don't want to." "You know that I came here from <a class="placename" href="#vothL13">Paris</a> to ask you about it." "No, we don't want to. Not in million years. What is it? What orders? Where are there some orders?" "Please." I was there with a colleague of mine [unclear]. I told him: "Listen [unclear] maybe you should talk to them, as a brother to a brother." He went. He said: "Why do you have to [unclear]? She specially came from <a class="placename" href="#vothL13">Paris</a>. [Unclear] Why do you behave like this?" There was a terrible noise. What happened there, I got a feeling that they could kill him. Suddenly in five minutes, out of the blue [unclear] it passed; they approached me, they hugged me, they kissed me. They came on Saturday. We had one of the best evenings in our club. They were amazing: They sang, they danced, they improvised. And everybody was happy—both the performers and . . . ahh . . . the audience. So [unclear]. Even now they live in horrible conditions. Jewish organizations do everything they want but unfortunately there is no cleanliness. There is a house here where they live. It is unimaginably dirty. So they told me: "We left one camp for the other." There were more bedbugs than . . . hmm . . . happiness.</span>

And it's absolutely normal. These people are thrown off their stride. They were taken away at the age of 14-15 years. They lived in inhuman conditions. They were forced to work. They worked too hard for nothing. And now when they are told: "You have to learn some trade so you can work," their first reaction is: "What?! Work?! We have worked enough. Others have to work for us now." But gradually it will get straightened out. We give them everything that we only can. We give them love, care, we give them [unclear]. Our teachers treat each of our student as their own child. We call them our children. We love them, we sincerely love them. We care for them not only from the educational aspect but also from a physical and moral point of view. Children learn to love this home. We create some entertainment for them—we have a club. They go out, they do sports. We teach them to read, we teach them various languages. And slowly these children get pulled into this normal life. I call them all children as I believe that they lost so many years, so much time—they remain at the same level as they were when they left. There is a boy who . . . or a girl . . . who was taken away at 14 years of age and who didn't acquire anything but bad for the last 5 years. Germans did everything they could to destroy in them any human resemblance. And now when we see that children are changing, that they start to love their trade . . . We have a boy.

            The so-called "Free Zone" or unoccupied zone was the part of France controlled by the Vichy government following the French defeat by Germany in June 1940.

            Eight provinces in mountainous southeastern France and on the French Riviera were under Italian influence following the defeat of France in June 1940. Once the Germans occupied the Italian zone in November 1942, these provinces came under direct Italian rule, including the city of Voiron, located northwest of Grenoble. The Italians sheltered thousands of Jews in their zone until September 1943 when it was taken over by the Germans.

            In July 1943, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini fell from power, and on September 8, 1943, Italy switched sides in the war and signed an armistice with the Allies (not Nazi Germany). Following the armistice, the Germans occupied the Italian-controlled zone of France, and raids on Jews and members of the Resistance began.

            As the war continued, Germany was increasingly faced with a shortage of labor. Some 700,000 Frenchmen were forced to work in Germany after being sent there by the Vichy government. They were among the millions from all over Europe taken into forced labor.

            This round-up occurred after the September 1943 take-over of the Italian zone by the Germans. Drancy was the infamous camp located in a suburb of Paris. It was the main transit camp for Jews in France to forced labor and to extermination camps, mainly Auschwitz. Some 65,000 Jews went to their deaths from Drancy. From July 2, 1943 to August 17, 1944, the camp was under the direct control of the SS, headed by Adolf Eichmann's deputy Alois Brunner, who made every effort to send as many Jews as possible to Auschwitz.

            On August 15, 1944, French and American troops landed in southern France and within two weeks captured Marseille and Nice. They then began a rapid advance up the Rhone valley. In southwestern and central France, the Resistance (also referred to as the Maquis) itself brought about liberation as the Germans fled.

            By October 1944 most of France had indeed been liberated, but bitter fighting—in which the western Allies, including free French forces under General de Gaulle, took part—continued.

            There was a brothel in Auschwitz and in several other camps staffed by non-Jewish women to provide sex to selected non-Jewish prisoners in a misguided effort to stimulate prisoner productivity by rewarding certain inmates with visits to the brothel. The brothels in Auschwitz and in other camps are discussed in Das KZ-Bordell: Sexuelle Zwangsarbeit in Nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslagern (Robert Sommer, Paderborn: Ferdinand Schöningh, 2009). According to this carefully researched work, there were no Jewish women in concentration camp brothels.

            It is possible that these women disguised their identity and worked in brothels for Wehrmacht soldiers. There were hundreds of such brothels all over Europe. Unfortunately, there were those in France who assumed (out of ignorance or anti-Semitic motives) that all Jews who returned from camps had done something dishonorable in order to survive. Survivors had to counter accusations that women had served in brothels and men had been cruel capos or informers.

            The accounts of pseudoscientific medical experiments and death of bunkmates during the night were among the horrors that occurred in Nazi concentration camps. Monk perhaps saw it as her moral duty to remember these stories and through the interview has passed these memories down to us.

            Gurs, located some fifty miles from the Spanish border in southern France, was the first (April 1939) and one of the largest detention camps established on French soil. Those first incarcerated there were Spanish republican soldiers who crossed the French border after the victory of Franco's forces in the Spanish Civil War.

                <li>
            <a name="note_46"></a>
            Some 6,000 Jews were deported from Gurs by way of Drancy to Auschwitz and Sobibor. Only a handful of Jews were left when the camp was liberated in the summer of 1944. Nearly 1,200 Jews died there.

            At the end of the war, the UGIF, which had functioned as the representative body of French Jewry during the Occupation, was dissolved. Monk might be referring to the Jewish Committee for Social Action and Reconstruction which clothed, fed and housed thousands of Holocaust survivors.

            Ravensbrück was the only Nazi concentration camp for women. It was also a training center for female SS guards and a site for gruesome pseudoscientific medical experiments.

             Contrary to the numbers given here, some 78,000 Jews in France perished during the Holocaust of the approximately 350,000 Jews in the country in June 1940. More than half of these were not French citizens; among them were an estimated 50,000 central European refugees who had come to France from 1933-39 and approximately 50,000 who had fled from Belgium in the wake of the German invasion in May 1940.

            The greatest single action against Jewish children in France came during the infamous July 1942 round-up and deportation of Jews in Paris. Of the 3,500 children deported to Auschwitz on August 7, 1942, none returned. As has been indicated above, approximately 700,000 Frenchmen worked in Germany as forced laborers during the war.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_53"></a>
             In fact, roughly 35,000 Jewish refugees came to France in the first three years after the war. When added to the already existing French Jewish population, this influx helped to make the French Jewish community the largest in continental Europe.

                The camp was opened after a roundup of in Paris Jews in August, 1941, in which over 4000 Jews were arrested.  Drancy was under the control of the French police until July 3, 1943 when Nazi Germany took day-to-day control as part of the major stepping up at all facilities for the mass exterminations.

            This round-up occurred after the September 1943 take-over of the Italian zone by the Germans. Drancy was the infamous camp located in a suburb of Paris. It was the main transit camp for Jews in France to forced labor and to extermination camps, mainly Auschwitz. Some 65,000 Jews went to their deaths from Drancy. From July 2, 1943 to August 17, 1944, the camp was under the direct control of the SS, headed by Adolf Eichmann's deputy Alois Brunner, who made every effort to send as many Jews as possible to Auschwitz.

            On August 15, 1944, French and American troops landed in southern France and within two weeks captured Marseille and Nice. They then began a rapid advance up the Rhone valley. In southwestern and central France, the Resistance (also referred to as the Maquis) itself brought about liberation as the Germans fled.

            There was a brothel in Auschwitz and in several other camps staffed by non-Jewish women to provide sex to selected non-Jewish prisoners in a misguided effort to stimulate prisoner productivity by rewarding certain inmates with visits to the brothel. The brothels in Auschwitz and in other camps are discussed in Das KZ-Bordell: Sexuelle Zwangsarbeit in Nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslagern (Robert Sommer, Paderborn: Ferdinand Schöningh, 2009). According to this carefully researched work, there were no Jewish women in concentration camp brothels.

            It is possible that these women disguised their identity and worked in brothels for Wehrmacht soldiers. There were hundreds of such brothels all over Europe. Unfortunately, there were those in France who assumed (out of ignorance or anti-Semitic motives) that all Jews who returned from camps had done something dishonorable in order to survive. Survivors had to counter accusations that women had served in brothels and men had been cruel capos or informers.

            Gurs, located some fifty miles from the Spanish border in southern France, was the first (April 1939) and one of the largest detention camps established on French soil. Those first incarcerated there were Spanish republican soldiers who crossed the French border after the victory of Franco's forces in the Spanish Civil War.

More than half of these were not French citizens; among them were an estimated 50,000 central European refugees who had come to France from 1933-39 and approximately 50,000 who had fled from Belgium in the wake of the German invasion in May 1940.
