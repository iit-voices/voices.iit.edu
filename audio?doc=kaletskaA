November 14 1950, Chicago. Boder."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "31.765","u": "Wiesbaden, September . . . Wiesbaden, September 26, 1946. Already at three o&#39;clock. I have to leave this town at five to get to Frankfurt and then to Paris. [unintelligible] a bit personal. It is the last day of my work in Germany . . . which to a large extent, I have officially to be thankful to the UNNRA, and unofficially to our friend, Jack Thompson, of the Chicago Tribune, who has done so much to realize, to help me to realize this project."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "69.899","u": "I have before me a young woman . . . a young woman by the name of Chana or Anna Kaletska, meaning that her husband&#39;s name was Kaletski, and she is going to talk to us . . . Are you going to talk in Yiddish? [She apparently nods affirmatively.] She is going to talk to us in Yiddish."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "89.571","u": "[In Yiddish] Now then, Mrs. Kaletski, will you please tell us where you are from and where you were when all the troubles and, so to speak, worries of the war started?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "104.417","u": "I am from Poland somewhere between . . . and . . . [This part is not clear.]"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "122.337","u": "And where were you when the Germans came to Poland?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "127.165","u": "In 1939, September 1st, I was still with my parents together in Kielce. My father was an important citizen in Kielce for about thirty-five years. Together with us on the night of Friday- from Thursday to Friday it was- there happened to be with us my brother from Potianice and a child of my oldest sister, a grandchild twelve years old. At six o&#39;clock in the morning the first bombs fell over Kielce. I went down with my parents into the cellar, but my father did not want to go. He said: &#34;From this one cannot hide in the cellar.&#34; Then he &#34;said&#34; a chapter from the Psalms. My youngest brother was in the war on the Polish side. And with it I thought that the world had come to an end. To lose my youngest brother! I did not want to live any more. So naive I was then, to think that all I would lose in the war was my youngest brother. Once during the first days of September I got up especially early&#226;five o&#39;clock in the morning. There wasn&#39;t a single German to be seen on the street. So I said: &#34;Mother, dear, maybe it was only a dream. Maybe they are really not here.&#34; Unfortunately, it was not a dream.. They were there, and they were there for a long time. My father had to leave his home to hide somewhere in the suburb. The Gestapo was looking for him. I remained alone with my mother in five rooms, and all through the night I was clinging to the window, running around in search. Where are the people who used to come every night- every evening- to see my father? Where are the grandchildren, who are afraid to cross the street and to come upstairs? Nobody was there."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "263.303","u": "Please tell the facts."},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "269.653","u": "In November I departed with my parents from . . . (name of locality incomprehensible). We were told there was a prisoners&#39; camp&#226;Pshemish. I went across to the Russian side. I was not far from Grodno, and there I found everybody alive, and I looked for a place where I could bring over my parents. But in March it was already too late to bring somebody over, and so I remained in Grodno. Among the Russians the Jews lived just like all the other peoples."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "299.711","u": "How did you get from Kielce to Grodno?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "302.242","u": "I just got over there."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "310.314","u": "You alone?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "311.704","u": "All alone without my folks, without a means to communicate with them. I remained in Grodno."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "320.943","u": "How old are you now?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "322.990","u": "Thirty-four years. Yesterday was my birthday."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "326.724","u": "On the eve of the New Year?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "328.786","u": "In Grodno the Jews lived just like the other people. First there were those who lived in Poland before, and then there were those who came from the zone occupied by the Germans. And they all lived together. Some lived in the synagogues or in the streets, but still they all lived together. Somehow I adjusted myself in Grodno. One has to live. The only thing was the terrible worry about my parents, and the homesickness. And all day and all night fire was pouring over Grodno, and within a single twenty-four hours sixty per-cent of the city was destroyed; and we remained alive. I lived on a street in No. 9; No. 11 burned down. No&#39;s. 27,23, and 9- I remained alive. At No. 11 and at one side of No. 9, there fell a bomb, destroying everything. I remained alive- and again there came the Germans. In a monstrous fashion they chased people through the streets, and it soon started all over. This was in the East, with special laws. In a few days I got the idea that my husband was alive."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "425.896","u": "It occurred to you, or you knew?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "427.442","u": "I got the idea that my husband was alive and somewhere hiding in a village among the Germans, a prisoner. I wanted to run, but where to run? They didn&#39;t threaten me. I had to wait, and in a few days he came."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "446.589","u": "He returned?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "447.777","u": "Yes."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "449.198","u": "What does it mean- you got an idea&#39;? Somebody has written to you?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "451.714","u": "No. At that time there came people who were together with him- with my man. And so they first brought me an idea.. [She apparently has used the Hebrew word &#34;yidie&#34; which means &#34;message&#34;.] And my man succeeded in &#34;blacking himself across.&#34; *The word &#34;black&#34; is a designation for illegal action, as in &#34;black market&#34; or &#34;black papers,&#34; and it has become a verb- to do something illegal is often spoken of as &#34;to black.&#34; *, to Wolkowysk and to mingle in with other prisoners. He had an uncle there, and so we got together. During the summer they still let us live in our apartment, although my husband had to work very hard, from six o&#39;clock in the morning until six o&#39;clock at night, together with all the others. And we still had at home some belongings, and we sold them, and we ate, and we hoped that possibly we might survive. The first of November we were driven into the Ghetto."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "502.699","u": "Where?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "503.574","u": "In Grodno, into the ghetto. They arranged two ghetto, one in Slobodka [The name Slobodka often is used to designate the poorer suburbs, or slums.] and one ghetto in the yard of the synagogue. At the beginning, the day when we came to the ghetto the wires were not ready, and it did not make such a terrible impression. But the next day everything was fenced up and there was an inscription on the gate- &#34;From here one does not return.&#34; . . . [She is very much upset and for the next two sentences the wire is not clear.] We have learned that the Jew should never give up hope, and his spirit should never falter. But the heart was heavy. It was hard to bear. I was in my ninth month. We used to live like affluent citizens, my father-in-law, my man, and my sister-in-law. Now we were given a room of eight and one-half cubic meters,-- no, squares; I don&#39;t know how many cubic meters there were. And there I was to give birth to my child. One day they opened the ghetto, and every Jew was permitted to go into his home to fetch some things. Then my father-in-law went back to his home, and he saw the destruction of the home for which he has been working for thirty-years- and he returned gravely ill. He never got well again."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "583.424","u": "What do you mean- he saw the destruction?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "585.424","u": "There was his home, and he saw how it was ransacked and ruined."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "588.768","u": "Who ransacked and ruined it?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "590.658","u": "We left the house just as it was, with only the things on our body and a few bundles in our hands. And everything else had to be left. And the people, of course, who lived around- what did they care about the Jews! They just waited for such a moment. They went inside. The things of value the Gestapo themselves hauled away. My father-in-law had been working hard all his life, and when he saw what had become of his home, he took badly sick, and he remained sick up until the end. The 26th of November I gave birth to my child in the ghetto in my room, because there was not yet a Jewish hospital. The doctor- and everybody&#226;tried to comfort me. On the third day after my child was born, we were informed that we would be driven into barracks to Kelbasin, six kilometers away from Grodno. There were seventy thousand Russian prisoners, and after six weeks there remained only six thousand. To such a place they wanted to drive us away."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "679.203","u": "What do you mean, there remained only six thousand?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "681.812","u": "They died off from spotted fever, from various contagious diseases, as well as from starvation. I was not in Kelbasin, but a part of the Grodno Jews a year later were in Kelbasin, and there they died by the thousands. In the middle of Kelbasin there was an open pit, where they would throw the children, and they did not cover it up until it was full. Dead Jewish children. We did not go then to Kelbasin. They let us stay in the ghetto for a year."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "715.763","u": "[In English] This concludes spool . . . This concludes Spool 164 which the . . . for 27 minutes was taken by Mr. Jack Matzner and then taken over by Mrs. Anna Kaletska. We are going over with Mrs. Kaletska to Spool 165. We are going over with Mrs. Kaletska to spool . . . Wiesbaden, September the 26th, 1946. My last day of interviewing in Germany&#226;I usually do not mention my name in these spools, but I am finishing a piece of work which I hope will do some good."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "750.882","u": "[In English] Wiesbaden, September the 26th, 1946. Last day of the project in Germany. I have before me Mrs. Anna Kaletska, 34 years old, who will continue her report from Spool 164 to Spool 165. She&#39;s rather emotional and she cannot mobilize [unintelligible] with her voice [unintelligible]. Volume control is a bit high, which may not give a very good reproduction but it will be enough for transcription."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "780.397","u": "[In Yiddish] And so you had your baby? What was it, a boy or a girl?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "785.381","u": "A little girl."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "786.162","u": "And you continued living for a whole year in the ghetto?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "789.583","u": "In the ghetto."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "789.942","u": "Now go ahead."},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "790.848","u": "At the end of the summer people began to arrive from everywhere. From here, from there, from Brest-Litovak, from Lemberg."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "802.764","u": "Did you know anybody in Slonim? Do you remember any name?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "806.701","u": "There was a Jew from Kielce in Slonim, a son of a very prominent, wealthy man from Kielce, Chaim Zagalski, with his daughter; he ran away from Kielce, and they were heard of from Slonim. And we sent a man from Grodno to bring him over. So he found the door nailed shut, the house empty; Chaim Zagalski was not there any more. There were left in Slonim about two hundred Jews, out of a population of nine thousand Jews before the start of the slaughter, or possibly even more- I don&#39;t know. There were a lot of refugees from districts previously doomed by the Germans. I did not know the district of Slonim. There was a great Slonim rabbi, whose name I don&#39;t know. And these two hundred Jews had numbers hung on them (the Christians made them wear them), and they had to report every day to the square, an place of roll call, and they were sent to work. Work! We too had worries about work! The day my man was working, we had hope to survive that day. But when people came to the gates of the ghetto and said, &#34;no more work required,&#34; that was a dark day. We knew it was coming. November 1, 1942, the ghetto was surrounded. Every few steps stood an armed German, with his gun ready, and at some distance on the hill machine guns. They told us nothing, but they took us &#34;to work.&#34; We knew what that meant. And nearby were Russians, Poles; not all but many were waiting for what they could inherit from the Jews. Possibly they had waited so that in case the Germans themselves would not put an end to us, they could step in."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "914.809","u": "Step in for what?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "915.747","u": "So they could consummate the terrible deed. That is what we were told from Brest-Litovsk and other Ukranian cities. And in Russia, as far as Stalingrad and the Ural [mountains], the Germans did it themselves. They could not relinquish the &#34;sacred labor&#34;, and they had their mission. However, it did not start that day, nor later. With a sadistic forethought, they told us: &#34;Have no care, this will become a labor lager, my word of honor.&#34; said Herr Ehrlich, the Gestapo chief, to the Community Council. &#34;Mass murder! Oh, no; that is out of the question- deportation, neither!! It will be converted into a work-lager, no more loafing. And believe me, my word of honor.&#34; Believe his word of honor! In two weeks it started. First we saw them transporting the inhabitants of the smaller towns, from Slobodka,&#226;on horse carts, old, broken down, sick people, and on foot the young ones; towards Bialystok they were led. And when they were through with the small towns, it commenced in Grodne. First came Slobodka. The first street. . . . my father,&#226;that is, my father-in-law,&#226;I must save my child. Possibly we should get away at night to some Poles, old acquaintances, and hide there. My husband, myself, my sister-in-law, and a girl friend who was with us, we shall get away to the partisans, and Father with the child should remain with the Poles. But he refused. And so it was. He resigned himself to death. To me he said: &#34;Take the child and save yourselves. Go to the other ghetto. There they are still allowed to remain.&#34; I was the first to go over to the second ghetto with the child. In a few days came my man. Father told him: &#34;For the sake of the child, go!&#34; He himself remained there. His younger daughter Zina- he could not abandon her, and they both went off with a transport, most probably to Treblinka. Within a week they started the ghetto in the yard of the synagogue. The most horrible was that the Jewish Police (at the beginning we were not told about the horrible role they would have to play) they came and led us, assembled for the slaughter there, to the synagogue, at night. Every few nights we would sit up&#226;I, my man (the child was asleep, all dressed, and we expected the police to come after us. Every night we said Vida (the prayer of those who expect to die) of our own composition, and forgave each other, but they did not come. My man worked then as a carpenter (he is a lumber sorter by trade), and this kept us there. Once my man said: &#34;I can&#39;t make peace with them. Our child must be saved even if we two shall die. We have nobody any more. You look like a Christian; get out with the child. Put it next to a Christian orphanage. Orphans also may be lucky sometimes. I can&#39;t want her to die.&#34; It snowed that night. It was 25 degrees cold. [Below zero centigrade.] Sixteen Jews fell at the gate in the first attempt to escape. I went over the wires in the second attempt, and my man handed me the child, and I carried her away."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1152.222","u": "How did you get over the wires?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "1153.753","u": "My man set up a chair for me. He raised one wire, and I crawled through."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1158.924","u": "Weren&#39;t those electric wires?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "1161.564","u": "No, then they had no electric wires. He handed me the child. And I went out in the street. I removed the yellow patch, and I went down the street. It was eight o&#39;clock. At nine o&#39;clock it was curfew hour. I did not know where to go. All at once I remembered a Christian woman whom I happened to know, and I went to her and said: &#34;This is all that I have got; take the child and carry it to an orphanage. Say, you have found it in the street. I am returning to my man, and we shall perish together.&#34; She started to wring her hands, a Christian woman whom I had possibly seen only twice before. And she said: &#34;I am afraid (the Poles were threatened with death for such things); put her in the street. I will come out of the house with a neighbor woman; we shall come out as if by accident. I will pick up the child and take her tomorrow to the orphanage, but you go away immediately.&#34; And so she has taken my child. I went with her down to the door, and there I stood across the street, hidden in the gate, and I saw how my child was lying on the snow. And here, I could not pick her up, the child that I had brought into the world! I knew that that will save her life. That is what I hoped. [A few words in this sentence are not clear. She is sobbing, and even by slowing down the wire and listening to this section over and over, I have been able to understand only about three words. I do not think that the translation of the phrase &#34;the child I brought into the world&#34; is entirely correct.] In a few minutes she came out of the house and picked up the child. I ran away through the streets of Grodno, and I didn&#39;t think of the curfew&#226;that I might be caught,&#226;and I didn&#39;t know how to get back to the ghetto, as it was such a late hour. There was a Christian woman in the city, with whom I had once worked during the time of the Soviets. I stepped in to her, and a girl friend of mine was hiding there. I entered the house, and I said, &#34;Panuvka *This is a respectful and at the same time endearing name for a Polish woman. *, I don&#39;t have my child any more. How light my hands feel!&#34; Then she said, &#34;Twenty-six hours you have suffered to bring her into the world, and now you will suffer as long as you live.&#34; I didn&#39;t ask her for much&#226;just to keep me over night. She couldn&#39;t help me for much longer, because on Sunday no one could show himself in the city. The Germans were grabbing the people and dragging them to work in Germany. I wanted to return to the ghetto. Then thousand Jews were deported that day. The ghetto was surrounded. One couldn&#39;t get in, nor could one get out. Part were going to Treblinka, and to get in one also didn&#39;t know how. I ran into a Christian&#226;he was a working man. [Recording not clear.] I told him I am a Jewess&#226;&#34;I can&#39;t get into the ghetto.&#34; And he said, &#34;Get out of the city. You do not look Jewish. Go where ever you can, but don&#39;t remain here. You see here it burns.&#34; And so I departed alone, without papers, into the woods. I did not know the roads. Through the woods, into a Russian village. I entered. &#34;Give me some water.&#34; If one is alive, one has to drink water. And sometimes one has to eat. Everybody gave me something. I did not look Jewish, but they knew&#226;what else could be driving me in the snow through the woods? Everyone kept me for one night."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1376.760","u": "The Christians?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "1377.401","u": "The Christians&#226;I can&#39;t complain. Everybody gave me warm water to wash myself. They gave me food, so that I should have strength to wander farther. And there was a preacher&#226;A Christian, a Catholic. He hid me &#34;for strength&#34; for eight days. But it drove me back to Grodno to find out what was going on. The priest encountered some Jews that were going to work. She he asked them: &#34;Do you know whether Jack Kovitzki is there?&#34; So they said: &#34;He is there, he has remained alive.&#34; Three thousand Jews were still in Grodno. So he said, &#34;Tell him that his wife is alive&#226;that she does not want to remain among us. She wants to go back, and in a few days she will be back.&#34; The next week he took me out part of the way in a cart&#226;to go further, he was afraid. And I went alone towards Grodno&#226;I can&#39;t remember how many kilometers. I arrived in Grodno. It&#39;s the same story again&#226;how does one get in&#226;into the ghetto? And then it occurred to me that my father had a chauffeur, a Christian, a decent man."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1444.894","u": "He had a what?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "1445.925","u": "A chauffeur."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1446.768","u": "A chauffeur?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "1447.627","u": "A driver."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1448.643","u": "(hesitantly) Did he have a --?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "1449.830","u": "(interrupting) Yes, my father-in-law, had--"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "1451.033","u": "An automobile?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "1452.596","u": "Yes. He was a good business man; so he had an automobile and a driver&#226;a very decent person. He lives now in the yard of the house that once belonged to my father-in-law. So I went to him. He didn&#39;t know me, but I gave the name of Meyer Kovitzki, and he said: &#34;Don&#39;t be afraid. You can be with me as long as you want.&#34; But he had a wife and a child, and I did not want to cause him anxiety. So I went down to the cellar, and he went to the ghetto to find out about things, and Friday morning his own wife went with me through the streets, and she led me to the ghetto. Then another Pole helped me to get in. But before I went in, he told me: &#34;You know where you are going?&#34; And I said, &#34;Where is my man, and where is my place?&#34; That was on Friday noon. I was there all night until five o&#39;clock in the morning. At five o&#39;clock in the morning again shooting and screaming. A new transport. And I and my husband went to this transport towards the synagogue. Then the whole night we stayed in the synagogue. In the synagogue it was crowded&#226;heavy and crowded. One could not breathe. The whole night without a drop of water, and outside the shooting. At two o&#39;clock in the morning we were driven out to the train. And my husband said: &#34;No, you are not going to die. Because you have returned to me, is that why you should perish?&#34; And I said, &#34;I cannot be&#226;I am already tired. Maybe I shall rest in the grave.&#34; But he did not wish to understand, and just one street away from the train he pushed me into a gate, in spite of the guards, because it was still dark.

There appeared one day in my block a distant cousin of mine, a girl, Nelly Kovitzka, a seventeen-year old girl. Her face was that of my little girl. And I was overcome with hope I should return. Maybe she is alive . . . [three or four words unintelligible]. And I started to fight again, to struggle for life, in Auschwitz. I became a- I was cleaning the block.

In spite of the fact that she would beat us, and in spite of all that, she was fighting for the life of every prisoner. For the Christians she did not have to fight. Christians normally did not go to the ovens, only those who had died. But for the Jews she had to fight. Two years ago [this with some hidden light in her voice] on Rosh Hashona [the interview was taking place on Rosh Hashona of 1946, and she apparently refers to an incident exactly two years before] just two years ago, there was to be a selection. A selection was when they re-sorted the people&#226;who for the ovens and who should stay alive. So she took all the weak and the sick, including myself, and sent them away outside the lager for work, Aussenkomando, so they should not be present for the &#34;selection.&#34; However, there was no selection afterwards.

In September more transports were sent away, and we didn&#39;t know where to. In October I decided to get away from Auschwitz. Be what it may, better come death, but no Auschwitz. To have to look on how living human beings stand in line waiting for death, and to say nothing, and they don&#39;t even cry. They would not cry. Once the Christian block                         trustys reproached me: &#34;Why are they going with such indifference to death? Why don&#39;t they fight? Why don&#39;t they kill somebody?&#34; So I replied, &#34;You haven&#39;t been in a ghetto. You have not seen how Jews went away in transports with congealed nerves [verglievert]. A human being can cry himself dry; a human being clings to life, and up to the last moment there is a ray of hope and they are defenseless. And they have no arms. How can you say that? Maybe you just want to soothe your conscience talking that way.&#34; And the same day a miracle happened. The Jews seized the oven.

An answer has come to what she had said the about the Jews. If others would be saying it, I wouldn&#39;t care; but if such a Christian, who was so valuable to us and respected, [should think that way]&#226;that we cared. Why should she say the Jews have no courage? That hurts. And now this happens. In October they began to assemble transports from Auschwitz. I had no hope to get away with the transport, because I looked very sick, but I dressed, and I painted myself for each appell, to give myself color&#226;they shouldn&#39;t see my deadly paleness."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2510.197","u": "What were you doing?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "2511.103","u": "For each appell I painted my face, so they shouldn&#39;t see how terribly pale I was."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "2515.637","u": "Where did you get the stuff?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "2516.887","u": "Well, there would come transports of Jews from all over the world, and they did not know what their fate would be. So every woman still had these things. And they would lie on the dumps, and those who had access to the dumps would collect it and would give it to everyone who looked bad, to cover it up. And so I was heavily painted. One day they came to our block and told us that we are going to the transport&#226;to lead us to a transport block. And I too was selected during the appell. And so we went to block 31, the transit block. Here we remained for eight days. Then there was a selection and we were sent to the shower bath. That was a bathing room, where people would bathe, and afterward everyone was looked over. For me that was very dangerous; so a woman, a block servant, told me: &#34;Don&#39;t go in there. Simply sneak out through the other side and stand up with those on the right side, because externally you look well.&#34; And so I mingled in with three hundred other women, and I went away with a transport to Lippstadt. In Lippstadt there was work. In Auschwitz there was no work. In Lippstadt they manufactured ammunition, and there the strength to live returned to me. To work!&#226;I should stamp cartridges for machine guns, with which the Germans would shoot (and these were the last munition factories) the Americans who came to liberate us! And because I looked so [decrepit] they thought that I was such a fool! In a few days I learned the mechanism of my machine, and in a few days I started to work very ardently. The assigned quota was twelve thousand, but I would produce fifteen thousand pieces. But fifteen thousand smaller ones and fifteen thousand larger ones, never the caliber that was prescribed. When they discovered it, there were eighty thousand rejected pieces. My foreman came over to me and said: &#34;If you do it once more, I shall chop off your hand.&#34; So I said, &#34;Oh [here her voice becomes ironical, and she speaks in perfect German], you can report that I am doing sabotage? Then they make me altogether kaput.&#34; &#34;Oh, for that you are much too dumb!&#34; I don&#39;t know, maybe he had noticed what I was doing, but it may have been too late, and he already was responsible along with me. I can&#39;t be so naive as to assume that the Germans wanted to cooperate with me against Hitler. Such do not exist. But to the last moment they had fate. In the faces of the Germans I read just like in a newspaper. They were very sad the last days. It was already the year 1945, in March. They still drove us to work, and they would beat us at every air raid alarm. But, thank God! The air raid alarm would last for twenty-four hours. They would run into the air raid shelter, and we would run right out into the yard. We would run out into the yard, and laugh, and the SS men would say to us: &#34;Aren&#39;t you afraid? Do you think that your friends will spare you?&#34; [She continues with laughter in her voice] &#34;You are afraid! Why aren&#39;t you in the battlefield? All you are fighting with is eight hundred defenseless and weak women. That is the kind of heroes you are!&#34; The girls thought that I was again insane, like I had been in Auschwitz. But it was indifferent to me. [Here again the record loses its clearness]. To die in such a fashion may be well worth while.

[Her words are barely audible.] And speaking&#226;nobody could. We were all speechless. And then he understood, and two tears rolled down his face. [Again the text is not clear, she is very upset.] And until the others arrived, he wept with us. Not a Jew&#226;a Christian. And then they began to arrive, the tanks. It was Passover. The last day of it. And matzos [Unleavened bread, eaten by Jews at Easter] fell from the tanks. And chocolate and cigarettes. And they would jump off the tanks and they were kissing us. Us dirty and lousy ones. &#34;Do not weep,&#34; they would say. But we wept more and again. And incessantly the tears ran. The Ninth Army had not seen any Jews in Germany, and we thought that we were the only Jewish survivors, and we did not want to live. But they consoled us. They were telling us that there were many other armies that have reached other lagers which were liberated. That was liberation. We were all dead sick. I was half swollen. Immediately the American army led us into homes. They burned everything we had on us, although we wanted to save the clothing. But it was all infected, and we were afraid to keep it. Dirty. And we changed our clothes, putting on whatever we could. We could take things, good things, from the Germans. We took it from the Germans [with irony in her voice], they gave it to us themselves. They were afraid now. We dressed [here her voice again breaks into sobs]. We washed ourselves, with soap, warm water, a clean towel, pure underwear. [She uses the English word &#34;pure&#34;]. Oh!

Possibly somebody reported to them, because the child looked later very much like my husband. The Kovitzki&#39;s were a well-known family, and they all resembled each other very much. It was also suspicious, because the woman was childless, and she had not given away the child to an orphanage."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "3241.964","u": "Oh, she did not place the child in an orphanage?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "3243.370","u": "Because she loved the child, she kept the child like her own. And she left for me a present&#226;a few pictures. I will show them to you right away. [As I remember it, she looked in her pocketbook.] Oh, no. I don&#39;t have them with me. And they buried the child three weeks before the Red Army marched in. When the Red Army arrived the woman interfered, requesting a permit to bury the child. It was said that I apparently was not alive any more; but they wanted to remove the child from the Christian cemetery. The Jewish cemetery was entirely desecrated."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "3277.224","u": "Have you seen the woman afterwards?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "3279.146","u": "No, the woman I haven&#39;t seen any more."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "3280.334","u": "So, how did you get the pictures?"},    {"who": "Anna Kaletska", "start": "3281.849","u": "The pictures she left with a woman friend of mine who was saved. She lived on &#34;Aryan papers&#34; near Grodno. About twelve kilometers from there. And this woman friend of mine went to this [Christian] woman and wanted to take my child back. So she gave her the pictures. And so I don&#39;t have the child. Then there was a rumor that my husband was alive, Jacob Kovitzki. Somebody wrote from Kovno, but I didn&#39;t know where he is, and a year has passed. I was unable to find him. Maybe he went into Russia, but so far there is nothing from him. Now I am working in Pfalzheim, in a kindergarten. There are twenty little Jewish children. And I play with them, and then I forget about all that. Again I have around me Jewish children. But after work, to come alone to my room&#226;today is a holiday. Where are all mine, who used to celebrate the holidays with me? Thank God! There are Jews staying with me on a holiday. Not a holiday in Auschwitz. But my people are no more. I am alone. [This whole section on Spool 167 was spoken with sobs, which are clearly heard on the wire. The woman was very much beside herself. I had a hard time to keep her in line with the microphone, and now I don&#39;t find a little episode which she told me, apparently after I had stopped the machine. It is not on the wire, but here it is, written from memory: &#34;Last night, and that means on the first evening of Rosh Hashona we, like at home, prepared the holiday meal, and as was customary at home, we invited a soldier to share it with us. But this time it was not a poor soldier, away from home, who had to be fed, but an American Jewish soldier, who, accepting the invitation, brought us an armful of gifts, all kinds of American food and delicacies.&#34;]"},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "3368.180","u": "[In English] We have to conclude, my automobile is waiting. [unintelligible] . . . very valuable material, that I have to cancel another appointment. Wiesbaden, September the 46th, in the synagogue that was desecrated in 1937 or &#39;38, and which had its holiday service for the first time today, although not yet re-dedicated. What we have heard from this woman . . . is about a story what we have heard from everybody. I&#39;m concluding my project in Germany, and I want to thank the UNRRA, Jack Thompson from the Chicago Tribune, Paul and Ms. Gurman, Morris Alther, Henry McCarthy and Harriet McCarthy, my daughter Elena Boder and my son in law, Ledewitz, Dave Siegel, and all those who made this project possible. Ben Weintraub, and Eve in Munich. And also Salk. I can&#39;t speak, I don&#39;t recall, remember the names now because I am just in a trance after this woman&#39;s report. I am concluding this project, the automobile is waiting, I am going to Frankfurt. Who is going to sit in judgment of all this, and who is going to judge my work? Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording. I am leaving tonight for Paris, the project is concluded."}        ]

                    <p class="utterance">In 1939, September 1st, I was still with my parents together in Kielce. My father was an important citizen in Kielce for about thirty-five years. Together with us on the night of Friday- from Thursday to Friday it was- there happened to be with us my brother from Potianice and a child of my oldest sister, a grandchild twelve years old. At six o&#39;clock in the morning the first bombs fell over Kielce. I went down with my parents into the cellar, but my father did not want to go. He said: &#34;From this one cannot hide in the cellar.&#34; Then he &#34;said&#34; a chapter from the Psalms. My youngest brother was in the war on the Polish side. And with it I thought that the world had come to an end. To lose my youngest brother! I did not want to live any more. So naive I was then, to think that all I would lose in the war was my youngest brother. Once during the first days of September I got up especially early&#226;five o&#39;clock in the morning. There wasn&#39;t a single German to be seen on the street. So I said: &#34;Mother, dear, maybe it was only a dream. Maybe they are really not here.&#34; Unfortunately, it was not a dream.. They were there, and they were there for a long time. My father had to leave his home to hide somewhere in the suburb. The Gestapo was looking for him. I remained alone with my mother in five rooms, and all through the night I was clinging to the window, running around in search. Where are the people who used to come every night- every evening- to see my father? Where are the grandchildren, who are afraid to cross the street and to come upstairs? Nobody was there.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">In Grodno the Jews lived just like the other people. First there were those who lived in Poland before, and then there were those who came from the zone occupied by the Germans. And they all lived together. Some lived in the synagogues or in the streets, but still they all lived together. Somehow I adjusted myself in Grodno. One has to live. The only thing was the terrible worry about my parents, and the homesickness. And all day and all night fire was pouring over Grodno, and within a single twenty-four hours sixty per-cent of the city was destroyed; and we remained alive. I lived on a street in No. 9; No. 11 burned down. No&#39;s. 27,23, and 9- I remained alive. At No. 11 and at one side of No. 9, there fell a bomb, destroying everything. I remained alive- and again there came the Germans. In a monstrous fashion they chased people through the streets, and it soon started all over. This was in the East, with special laws. In a few days I got the idea that my husband was alive.</p>

During the summer they still let us live in our apartment, although my husband had to work very hard, from six o&#39;clock in the morning until six o&#39;clock at night, together with all the others. And we still had at home some belongings, and we sold them, and we ate, and we hoped that possibly we might survive. The first of November we were driven into the Ghetto.</p>

They arranged two ghetto, one in Slobodka [The name Slobodka often is used to designate the poorer suburbs, or slums.] and one ghetto in the yard of the synagogue. At the beginning, the day when we came to the ghetto the wires were not ready, and it did not make such a terrible impression. But the next day everything was fenced up and there was an inscription on the gate- &#34;From here one does not return.&#34; . . . [She is very much upset and for the next two sentences the wire is not clear.] We have learned that the Jew should never give up hope, and his spirit should never falter. But the heart was heavy. It was hard to bear. I was in my ninth month. We used to live like affluent citizens, my father-in-law, my man, and my sister-in-law. Now we were given a room of eight and one-half cubic meters,-- no, squares; I don&#39;t know how many cubic meters there were. And there I was to give birth to my child. One day they opened the ghetto, and every Jew was permitted to go into his home to fetch some things. Then my father-in-law went back to his home, and he saw the destruction of the home for which he has been working for thirty-years- and he returned gravely ill. He never got well again.</p>

And the people, of course, who lived around- what did they care about the Jews! They just waited for such a moment. They went inside. The things of value the Gestapo themselves hauled away. My father-in-law had been working hard all his life, and when he saw what had become of his home, he took badly sick, and he remained sick up until the end. The 26th of November I gave birth to my child in the ghetto in my room, because there was not yet a Jewish hospital. The doctor- and everybody&#226;tried to comfort me. On the third day after my child was born, we were informed that we would be driven into barracks to Kelbasin, six kilometers away from Grodno. There were seventy thousand Russian prisoners, and after six weeks there remained only six thousand. To such a place they wanted to drive us away.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">There was a Jew from Kielce in Slonim, a son of a very prominent, wealthy man from Kielce, Chaim Zagalski, with his daughter; he ran away from Kielce, and they were heard of from Slonim. And we sent a man from Grodno to bring him over. So he found the door nailed shut, the house empty; Chaim Zagalski was not there any more. There were left in Slonim about two hundred Jews, out of a population of nine thousand Jews before the start of the slaughter, or possibly even more- I don&#39;t know. There were a lot of refugees from districts previously doomed by the Germans. I did not know the district of Slonim. There was a great Slonim rabbi, whose name I don&#39;t know. And these two hundred Jews had numbers hung on them (the Christians made them wear them), and they had to report every day to the square, an place of roll call, and they were sent to work. Work! We too had worries about work! The day my man was working, we had hope to survive that day. But when people came to the gates of the ghetto and said, &#34;no more work required,&#34; that was a dark day. We knew it was coming. November 1, 1942, the ghetto was surrounded. Every few steps stood an armed German, with his gun ready, and at some distance on the hill machine guns. They told us nothing, but they took us &#34;to work.&#34; We knew what that meant. And nearby were Russians, Poles; not all but many were waiting for what they could inherit from the Jews. Possibly they had waited so that in case the Germans themselves would not put an end to us, they could step in.</p>

And in Russia, as far as Stalingrad and the Ural [mountains], the Germans did it themselves. They could not relinquish the &#34;sacred labor&#34;, and they had their mission. However, it did not start that day, nor later. With a sadistic forethought, they told us: &#34;Have no care, this will become a labor lager, my word of honor.&#34; said Herr Ehrlich, the Gestapo chief, to the Community Council. &#34;Mass murder! Oh, no; that is out of the question- deportation, neither!! It will be converted into a work-lager, no more loafing. And believe me, my word of honor.&#34; Believe his word of honor! In two weeks it started. First we saw them transporting the inhabitants of the smaller towns, from Slobodka,&#226;on horse carts, old, broken down, sick people, and on foot the young ones; towards Bialystok they were led. And when they were through with the small towns, it commenced in Grodne. First came Slobodka. The first street. . . . my father,&#226;that is, my father-in-law,&#226;I must save my child. Possibly we should get away at night to some Poles, old acquaintances, and hide there. My husband, myself, my sister-in-law, and a girl friend who was with us, we shall get away to the partisans, and Father with the child should remain with the Poles. But he refused. And so it was. He resigned himself to death. To me he said: &#34;Take the child and save yourselves. Go to the other ghetto. There they are still allowed to remain.&#34; I was the first to go over to the second ghetto with the child. In a few days came my man. Father told him: &#34;For the sake of the child, go!&#34; He himself remained there. His younger daughter Zina- he could not abandon her, and they both went off with a transport, most probably to Treblinka. Within a week they started the ghetto in the yard of the synagogue. The most horrible was that the Jewish Police (at the beginning we were not told about the horrible role they would have to play) they came and led us, assembled for the slaughter there, to the synagogue, at night. Every few nights we would sit up&#226;I, my man (the child was asleep, all dressed, and we expected the police to come after us. Every night we said Vida (the prayer of those who expect to die) of our own composition, and forgave each other, but they did not come. My man worked then as a carpenter (he is a lumber sorter by trade), and this kept us there. Once my man said: &#34;I can&#39;t make peace with them. Our child must be saved even if we two shall die. We have nobody any more. You look like a Christian; get out with the child. Put it next to a Christian orphanage. Orphans also may be lucky sometimes. I can&#39;t want her to die.&#34; It snowed that night. It was 25 degrees cold. [Below zero centigrade.] Sixteen Jews fell at the gate in the first attempt to escape. I went over the wires in the second attempt, and my man handed me the child, and I carried her away.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">No, then they had no electric wires. He handed me the child. And I went out in the street. I removed the yellow patch, and I went down the street. It was eight o&#39;clock. At nine o&#39;clock it was curfew hour. I did not know where to go. All at once I remembered a Christian woman whom I happened to know, and I went to her and said: &#34;This is all that I have got; take the child and carry it to an orphanage. Say, you have found it in the street. I am returning to my man, and we shall perish together.&#34; She started to wring her hands, a Christian woman whom I had possibly seen only twice before. And she said: &#34;I am afraid (the Poles were threatened with death for such things); put her in the street. I will come out of the house with a neighbor woman; we shall come out as if by accident. I will pick up the child and take her tomorrow to the orphanage, but you go away immediately.&#34; And so she has taken my child. I went with her down to the door, and there I stood across the street, hidden in the gate, and I saw how my child was lying on the snow. And here, I could not pick her up, the child that I had brought into the world! I knew that that will save her life. That is what I hoped. [A few words in this sentence are not clear. She is sobbing, and even by slowing down the wire and listening to this section over and over, I have been able to understand only about three words. I do not think that the translation of the phrase &#34;the child I brought into the world&#34; is entirely correct.] In a few minutes she came out of the house and picked up the child. I ran away through the streets of Grodno, and I didn&#39;t think of the curfew&#226;that I might be caught,&#226;and I didn&#39;t know how to get back to the ghetto, as it was such a late hour. There was a Christian woman in the city, with whom I had once worked during the time of the Soviets. I stepped in to her, and a girl friend of mine was hiding there. I entered the house, and I said, &#34;Panuvka *This is a respectful and at the same time endearing name for a Polish woman. *, I don&#39;t have my child any more. How light my hands feel!&#34; Then she said, &#34;Twenty-six hours you have suffered to bring her into the world, and now you will suffer as long as you live.&#34; I didn&#39;t ask her for much&#226;just to keep me over night. She couldn&#39;t help me for much longer, because on Sunday no one could show himself in the city. The Germans were grabbing the people and dragging them to work in Germany. I wanted to return to the ghetto. Then thousand Jews were deported that day. The ghetto was surrounded. One couldn&#39;t get in, nor could one get out. Part were going to Treblinka, and to get in one also didn&#39;t know how. I ran into a Christian&#226;he was a working man. [Recording not clear.] I told him I am a Jewess&#226;&#34;I can&#39;t get into the ghetto.&#34; And he said, &#34;Get out of the city. You do not look Jewish. Go where ever you can, but don&#39;t remain here. You see here it burns.&#34; And so I departed alone, without papers, into the woods. I did not know the roads. Through the woods, into a Russian village. I entered. &#34;Give me some water.&#34; If one is alive, one has to drink water. And sometimes one has to eat. Everybody gave me something. I did not look Jewish, but they knew&#226;what else could be driving me in the snow through the woods? Everyone kept me for one night.</p>

And there was a preacher&#226;A Christian, a Catholic. He hid me &#34;for strength&#34; for eight days. But it drove me back to Grodno to find out what was going on. The priest encountered some Jews that were going to work. She he asked them: &#34;Do you know whether Jack Kovitzki is there?&#34; So they said: &#34;He is there, he has remained alive.&#34; Three thousand Jews were still in Grodno. So he said, &#34;Tell him that his wife is alive&#226;that she does not want to remain among us. She wants to go back, and in a few days she will be back.&#34; The next week he took me out part of the way in a cart&#226;to go further, he was afraid. And I went alone towards Grodno&#226;I can&#39;t remember how many kilometers. I arrived in Grodno. It&#39;s the same story again&#226;how does one get in&#226;into the ghetto?

You can be with me as long as you want.&#34; But he had a wife and a child, and I did not want to cause him anxiety. So I went down to the cellar, and he went to the ghetto to find out about things, and Friday morning his own wife went with me through the streets, and she led me to the ghetto. Then another Pole helped me to get in. But before I went in, he told me: &#34;You know where you are going?&#34; And I said, &#34;Where is my man, and where is my place?&#34; That was on Friday noon. I was there all night until five o&#39;clock in the morning. At five o&#39;clock in the morning again shooting and screaming. A new transport. And I and my husband went to this transport towards the synagogue. Then the whole night we stayed in the synagogue. In the synagogue it was crowded&#226;heavy and crowded. One could not breathe. The whole night without a drop of water, and outside the shooting. At two o&#39;clock in the morning we were driven out to the train. And my husband said: &#34;No, you are not going to die. Because you have returned to me, is that why you should perish?&#34; And I said, &#34;I cannot be&#226;I am already tired. Maybe I shall rest in the grave.&#34; But he did not wish to understand, and just one street away from the train he pushed me into a gate, in spite of the guards, because it was still dark.

I am not ashamed.&#34; The whole night they kept us locked up, calling us out separately. My husband and then me alone, then both of us together.

Then my illness from before&#226;gall stones&#226;In Auschwitz&#226;in Auschwitz not to appear to the appell meant death, and still the supervisers of the barracks had pity on me and let me remain on the cot up to the last moment when already the SS men had come for roll call. Then they would drag me off the cot and lead me out. In Auschwitz I had a change of mind. I decided again to live. There appeared one day in my block a distant cousin of mine, a girl, Nelly Kovitzka, a seventeen-year old girl. Her face was that of my little girl. And I was overcome with hope I should return. Maybe she is alive . . . [three or four words unintelligible]. And I started to fight again, to struggle for life, in Auschwitz. I became a- I was cleaning the block. A block that housed thirteen hundred people. I cleaned it, I scrubbed it, and for that I would get another helping of soup, and at times I would get a little piece of bread that the blokova would leave uneaten. Then in spite of curfew I dressed up. In Auschwitz there was enough to wear. There was the clothing of the dead. They were burning people every day. The whole night the ovens would flame, and the skies red, dark red, just like . . . . [the next word is not clear.] One night I was standing in front of the block. A Christian block trusty stood near by. That night they were burning from the Gypsy Lager. I don&#39;t know how many thousands were there.</p>

I don&#39;t know. Possibly they were not even gassed, because of the horrible screams coming from there. Moreover one could somehow feel it. And there I was standing, and I mumbled to myself, and I said, &#34;Dante was just a dog. They know it much better.&#34; And the Christian woman heard it, and she said to me [and here she imitates a voice of extreme surprise], &#34;You know about Dante? How do you come to know anything about Dante?&#34; She thought that I always must have been looking like that&#226;like in Auschwitz. And from that night we became friends.</p>

Only afterwards I realized that she was a human being. In spite of the fact that she would beat us, and in spite of all that, she was fighting for the life of every prisoner. For the Christians she did not have to fight. Christians normally did not go to the ovens, only those who had died. But for the Jews she had to fight. Two years ago [this with some hidden light in her voice] on Rosh Hashona [the interview was taking place on Rosh Hashona of 1946, and she apparently refers to an incident exactly two years before] just two years ago, there was to be a selection. A selection was when they re-sorted the people&#226;who for the ovens and who should stay alive. So she took all the weak and the sick, including myself, and sent them away outside the lager for work, Aussenkomando, so they should not be present for the &#34;selection.&#34; However, there was no selection afterwards. But I became convinced that she was really human, that if she mistreated and beat us, it was only because she herself wanted to survive and wanted us to survive.</p>

So she herself cooked me some food that I could stand, and she shielded me and reported that I am working for her and that I do not have to go to work.

                    <p class="utterance">Yes, somebody came and told me; I went over there and managed to see them. But afterwards I did not believe that they were taken to a work camp, because nobody believes that one can come out alive from Auschwitz, although the Red Army was already at the gates of Warsaw. In September more transports were sent away, and we didn&#39;t know where to. In October I decided to get away from Auschwitz. Be what it may, better come death, but no Auschwitz. To have to look on how living human beings stand in line waiting for death, and to say nothing, and they don&#39;t even cry. They would not cry. Once the Christian block                         trustys reproached me: &#34;Why are they going with such indifference to death? Why don&#39;t they fight? Why don&#39;t they kill somebody?&#34; So I replied, &#34;You haven&#39;t been in a ghetto. You have not seen how Jews went away in transports with congealed nerves [verglievert]. A human being can cry himself dry; a human being clings to life, and up to the last moment there is a ray of hope and they are defenseless. And they have no arms. How can you say that? Maybe you just want to soothe your conscience talking that way.&#34; And the same day a miracle happened. The Jews seized the oven. They first threw in some forty SS men, and then, with them one hundred-fifty lost their lives, and a hundred-fifty ran away into the woods to the partisans. Of course, it was with help from outside, of partisans.- of Poles and other nationalities.</p>

Why should she say the Jews have no courage? That hurts. And now this happens. In October they began to assemble transports from Auschwitz.

                    <p class="utterance">Well, there would come transports of Jews from all over the world, and they did not know what their fate would be. So every woman still had these things. And they would lie on the dumps, and those who had access to the dumps would collect it and would give it to everyone who looked bad, to cover it up. And so I was heavily painted. One day they came to our block and told us that we are going to the transport&#226;to lead us to a transport block. And I too was selected during the appell. And so we went to block 31, the transit block. Here we remained for eight days. Then there was a selection and we were sent to the shower bath. That was a bathing room, where people would bathe, and afterward everyone was looked over. For me that was very dangerous; so a woman, a block servant, told me: &#34;Don&#39;t go in there. Simply sneak out through the other side and stand up with those on the right side, because externally you look well.&#34; And so I mingled in with three hundred other women, and I went away with a transport to Lippstadt. In Lippstadt there was work. In Auschwitz there was no work. In Lippstadt they manufactured ammunition, and there the strength to live returned to me. To work!&#226;I should stamp cartridges for machine guns, with which the Germans would shoot (and these were the last munition factories) the Americans who came to liberate us! And because I looked so [decrepit] they thought that I was such a fool! In a few days I learned the mechanism of my machine, and in a few days I started to work very ardently. The assigned quota was twelve thousand, but I would produce fifteen thousand pieces. But fifteen thousand smaller ones and fifteen thousand larger ones, never the caliber that was prescribed. When they discovered it, there were eighty thousand rejected pieces. My foreman came over to me and said: &#34;If you do it once more, I shall chop off your hand.&#34; So I said, &#34;Oh [here her voice becomes ironical, and she speaks in perfect German], you can report that I am doing sabotage? Then they make me altogether kaput.&#34; &#34;Oh, for that you are much too dumb!&#34; I don&#39;t know, maybe he had noticed what I was doing, but it may have been too late, and he already was responsible along with me. I can&#39;t be so naive as to assume that the Germans wanted to cooperate with me against Hitler. Such do not exist. But to the last moment they had fate. In the faces of the Germans I read just like in a newspaper. They were very sad the last days. It was already the year 1945, in March. They still drove us to work, and they would beat us at every air raid alarm. But, thank God! The air raid alarm would last for twenty-four hours. They would run into the air raid shelter, and we would run right out into the yard. We would run out into the yard, and laugh, and the SS men would say to us: &#34;Aren&#39;t you afraid? Do you think that your friends will spare you?&#34; [She continues with laughter in her voice] &#34;You are afraid! Why aren&#39;t you in the battlefield? All you are fighting with is eight hundred defenseless and weak women. That is the kind of heroes you are!&#34; The girls thought that I was again insane, like I had been in Auschwitz. But it was indifferent to me. [Here again the record loses its clearness]. To die in such a fashion may be well worth while. The 27th of March we were driven out of Lippstadt.</p>

Us dirty and lousy ones. &#34;Do not weep,&#34; they would say. But we wept more and again. And incessantly the tears ran. The Ninth Army had not seen any Jews in Germany, and we thought that we were the only Jewish survivors, and we did not want to live. But they consoled us. They were telling us that there were many other armies that have reached other lagers which were liberated. That was liberation. We were all dead sick. I was half swollen. Immediately the American army led us into homes. They burned everything we had on us, although we wanted to save the clothing. But it was all infected, and we were afraid to keep it. Dirty. And we changed our clothes, putting on whatever we could. We could take things, good things, from the Germans. We took it from the Germans [with irony in her voice], they gave it to us themselves. They were afraid now. We dressed [here her voice again breaks into sobs]. We washed ourselves, with soap, warm water, a clean towel, pure underwear. [She uses the English word &#34;pure&#34;]. Oh! The Americans themselves were crazy with joy. They now understood&#226;&#34;You are going to liberate human beings.&#34; And that army hadn&#39;t seen before those who were liberated. We were the first ones, and they were rejoicing like little children. And in the evening one American put on his head a hat, a German hat, a womans hat, and another one played some kind of instrument, and he danced with a little girl from our lager. I shall not forget it, ever. [She weeps again and speaks in exhaustion.] For the first time we got into the lager a radio, and we heard the news. Bergen-Belsen liberated. Thirty thousand hopelessly sick. Thousands and thousands dead. Who knows whether my people were there? Everybody thought so, and their eyes would run out [in tears.] Buchenwald.</p>

His wife recently gave birth to the child, and that is why he can&#39;t come yet. I hope every moment that they will arrive. My father had twenty-four grandchildren.

That Christian woman was held in jail with the child. An investigation was made, and it was found out that she had picked up the child on the street.

                    <p class="utterance">They&#226;I don&#39;t know how they established it. Possibly somebody reported to them, because the child looked later very much like my husband. The Kovitzki&#39;s were a well-known family, and they all resembled each other very much. It was also suspicious, because the woman was childless, and she had not given away the child to an orphanage.</p>

[As I remember it, she looked in her pocketbook.] Oh, no. I don&#39;t have them with me. And they buried the child three weeks before the Red Army marched in. When the Red Army arrived the woman interfered, requesting a permit to bury the child. It was said that I apparently was not alive any more; but they wanted to remove the child from the Christian cemetery. The Jewish cemetery was entirely desecrated.</p>

And this woman friend of mine went to this [Christian] woman and wanted to take my child back. So she gave her the pictures. And so I don&#39;t have the child. Then there was a rumor that my husband was alive, Jacob Kovitzki. Somebody wrote from Kovno, but I didn&#39;t know where he is, and a year has passed. I was unable to find him. Maybe he went into Russia, but so far there is nothing from him. Now I am working in Pfalzheim, in a kindergarten. There are twenty little Jewish children. And I play with them, and then I forget about all that. Again I have around me Jewish children. But after work, to come alone to my room&#226;today is a holiday. Where are all mine, who used to celebrate the holidays with me? Thank God! There are Jews staying with me on a holiday. Not a holiday in Auschwitz. But my people are no more. I am alone. [This whole section on Spool 167 was spoken with sobs, which are clearly heard on the wire. The woman was very much beside herself. I had a hard time to keep her in line with the microphone, and now I don&#39;t find a little episode which she told me, apparently after I had stopped the machine. It is not on the wire, but here it is, written from memory: &#34;Last night, and that means on the first evening of Rosh Hashona we, like at home, prepared the holiday meal, and as was customary at home, we invited a soldier to share it with us. But this time it was not a poor soldier, away from home, who had to be fed, but an American Jewish soldier, who, accepting the invitation, brought us an armful of gifts, all kinds of American food and delicacies.&#34;]</p>
