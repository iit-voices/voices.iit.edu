            As will be made clear later in the interview, Mrs. Button had an infant daughter who was cared for by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, a congregation of nuns devoted to active charitable works. At the time of the interview her daughter was still her only child.

            Most of the approximately 4,000 Jews of Spanish origin living in German occupied territories under Spanish diplomatic protection had received this status before World War I. Presumably this applied to Mrs. Button's parents as well because she indicates that "when I was a girl, I was Spanish"  having received this citizenship from her parents.

                <li>
            <a name="note_3"></a>
            By reinstating her Spanish citizenship as an adult, Mrs. Button became one of the 640  Spanish protected citizens in Greece. Since her husband had Greek citizenship, he could not become "Spanish again."

            The Germans conquered Salonika on April 9, 1941 and almost immediately confiscated Jewish apartments and looted Sephardic Jewish libraries with their great cultural treasures. The next fourteen months were relatively quiet, but beginning in the summer of 1942 persecution increased as some 2,000 Jewish males from Salonika were taken for forced labor. By October,1942, 250 had died.

            In early February 1943, a special SS contingent came to Salonkia to enforce the Nazis' so-called racial laws. Jews had to wear a yellow star, were forbidden to use public transportation and were forced to move into a ghetto, where living conditions immediately became difficult.

            It is unclear as to which papers Mrs. Button might be referring. Perhaps they were some sort of false papers for her husband.

            Mrs. Button had no way of knowing if she would ever see her baby daughter again, but should she one day be able to search for her the missing piece of the locket would help Mrs. Button identify her child.

            Close to 44,000 Jews were deported from Salonika to Auschitz-Birkenau from March 20 to August 18, 1943. Most were gassed upon arrival.

            Athens was then under the relatively benevolent rule of Fascist Italy which was allied with Nazi Germany at the time. Several thousand Jews from Salonika sought and found refuge in Athens, among them Mrs. Button. At the time, she had not yet received her Spanish citizenship papers so she feared deportation.

            When Italy capitulated to the Allies, the Germans occupied Athens on September 8, 1943, and Mrs. Button and her family were again in danger. As her following testimony indicates, the Button family, with the help of friendly Christians undertook energetic measures to save themselves.

                <li>
            <a name="note_13"></a>
            Archbishop Damaskinos of Athens was sympathetic to the Jews as were many Athenian Christians. The Archbishop encouraged Jews to hide in Christian institutions, supported giving them false papers, accepted Greek Jews who sought to convert to save themselves and agreed to arrange fictitious marriages.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_14"></a>
            Following the German occupation of the city, the Jews of Athens were ordered to register themselves with the community by October 7, 1943, hence Mrs. Button's concern about the date for the false marriage.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_15"></a>
            Sympathetic Athenian Greek Christians and Greek underground organizations sought to aid Jews to go into hiding and maintain them in their hiding places.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_16"></a>
            There were a few Jews who attempted to save themselves and their families by helping the Germans by informing on their co-religionists. There were also some non-Jews who betrayed Jews by informing the Germans of their whereabouts. As Mrs. Button later relates, she had to bribe the Jewish collaborator to prevent him from informing on her.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_17"></a>
            What Mrs. Button meant by "like this" was continuing to place her faith in the protection her Spanish citizenship papers would afford her.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_18"></a>
            Translator's Note: In German, the words for brother- and sister-in-law do not follow the word construction with "-in-law"/ "Schwieger-" but are different terms; Button, however, wrongly uses the "-in-law" for brother-in-law as well; she says "Schwiegerbruder" instead of the correct "Schwager"
        </li>
                <li>

            Barcelona is located in northeastern Spain and is a major Mediterranean port and Spanish population center. The "drive" to Barcelona was to be by train not by car.

            There was indeed a small group of Jews with Spanish citizenship who had been allowed into Spain. However, due to highly restrictive measures stipulated by the Spanish government for Jews with Spanish citizenship entering the country, those Jews from Athens with Spanish citizenship papers never made it to Spain.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_21"></a>
            The meaning of "that your father just to Auschwitz was..." is not clear. There is no prior indication that Mrs. Button's father was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. The only reference to her father in the interview is that by March 1944 "my father had long been dead." Is it possible that he did not have Spanish citizenship papers and perished in Auschwitz-Birkenau?
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_22"></a>
            We later learn that Mrs. Button and other Jews with Spanish citizenship from Athens were sent to Bergen Belsen. The question therefore arises, was the Spanish consul being disingenuous or did he really believe that the Athenian Jews with Spanish citizenship would be sent directly to Spain?
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_23"></a>
            This would argue for the fact that the Germans were using deceptive tactics in order to convince the Spanish consul that the Jews were indeed being sent to Spain so that he would aid in their departure from the city. One frequently encounters Nazi deceit during the Holocaust.

                <li>
            <a name="note_24"></a>
            "Greet" here seems to mean to see the Jews safely off on their journey.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_25"></a>
            Both Mrs. Button's mother and brother had Spanish citizenship papers.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_26"></a>
            Bergen-Belsen was actually liberated on April 15, 1945 by British armed forces.

                <li>
            <a name="note_27"></a>
            It is a bit puzzling as to why Boder did not inquire about Mrs. Button's experiences in Bergen Belsen especially since there was additional time remaining on the spool.

            The interview does not record how Mrs Button's husband managed to successfully escape from Athens to Palestine. Mrs. Button earlier related that he had escaped from Athens to neutral Turkey and then to Palestine. The Greek underground did assist in helping Jews escape across the Aegean to Turkey. Once in Turkey, Mr. Button might have received helped from Palestinian Jews.

            <a name="note_30"></a>
            Mrs. Button had told Boder at the start of the interview that the Sister Superior of the Daughters of Mercy of St. Vincent de Paul had brought her daughter from Salonika to Paris. We now learn that this was accomplished with the help of the Joint.

                Established in the spring of 1943 and initially intended as a transit camp, it soon was integrated into the concentration camp network.  Its population swelled late in the war as inmates from other camps further east were moved into it--from around 15,000 in late 1944 to 41,250 in March 1945.

            Most of the approximately 4,000 Jews of Spanish origin living in German occupied territories under Spanish diplomatic protection had received this status before World War I. Presumably this applied to Mrs. Button's parents as well because she indicates that "when I was a girl, I was Spanish"  having received this citizenship from her parents.

            The Germans conquered Salonika on April 9, 1941 and almost immediately confiscated Jewish apartments and looted Sephardic Jewish libraries with their great cultural treasures. The next fourteen months were relatively quiet, but beginning in the summer of 1942 persecution increased as some 2,000 Jewish males from Salonika were taken for forced labor. By October,1942, 250 had died.

Several thousand Jews from Salonika sought and found refuge in Athens, among them Mrs. Button. At the time, she had not yet received her Spanish citizenship papers so she feared deportation.
