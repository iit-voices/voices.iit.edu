            It is not entirely clear to what location Charles Jean is referring to when he says he was stationed at "Dunkerque in the Maine." The main point is that on June 4, 1940, Charles Jean became one of the 1.5 million young Frenchmen who became prisoners of war as a result of France's cataclysmic defeat at the hands of Germany.

            Vichy, renowned for its mineral waters, is located northeast of Lyon in south central France. It became the capital of the collaborationist French government during the German occupation. The parliament of the Third Republic met at Vichy on July 9-10, 1940 and voted itself out of existence, turning the reins of government over to the authoritarian Marshal Pétain who was authorized to draft a constitution establishing his regime.

            The obligatory German labor service, introduced in February 1943, was a great spur to young Frenchmen to join the resistance. It caused widespread discontent and contributed significantly to the loss of prestige by the Vichy regime as it proved itself incapable of shielding the French population from the onerous demands of the German occupation.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.

            It is not entirely clear to what location Charles Jean is referring to when he says he was stationed at "Dunkerque in the Maine." The main point is that on June 4, 1940, Charles Jean became one of the 1.5 million young Frenchmen who became prisoners of war as a result of France's cataclysmic defeat at the hands of Germany.

            Vichy, renowned for its mineral waters, is located northeast of Lyon in south central France. It became the capital of the collaborationist French government during the German occupation. The parliament of the Third Republic met at Vichy on July 9-10, 1940 and voted itself out of existence, turning the reins of government over to the authoritarian Marshal Pétain who was authorized to draft a constitution establishing his regime.

            The obligatory German labor service, introduced in February 1943, was a great spur to young Frenchmen to join the resistance. It caused widespread discontent and contributed significantly to the loss of prestige by the Vichy regime as it proved itself incapable of shielding the French population from the onerous demands of the German occupation.

            Thiers is a town located in south central France west of Clermont-Ferrand and south of Vichy. Despite the battles taking place at the time, the German obsession with murdering Jews was unceasing. As late as September 1944, one hundred Jews arrived in Auschwitz from Lyon, located due east of Thiers, four days before Lyon was liberated by French and Allied forces.
