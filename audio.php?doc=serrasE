There was a very great selection of the people who had come from Auschwitz. We were all driven outside and the elder of the lager, and he stood and selected the older women, who were to go in gas, and the younger women, who were to remain for work in the front trenches. He asked me how old I was. I told him I was thirty-four years, so he slapped me twice. He threw me to the ground; he trampled me with his feet; he beat me and he said to me, &#39;You dirty woman that you are. You believe that you may present yourself as a young child. You shall go into the gas chamber with all . . . the old women.&#39; And he put me among the old women. I made every effort to wiggle myself out. I wiggled myself out from their hands and ran away. I was able to run away because at that day there was a mass raid [?] for the gas chamber and they had no time to take the younger ones. They put the older women aside [kept them] until night, and at night they were led away to the gas chamber&#226;to the Jew lager, as it was called.
