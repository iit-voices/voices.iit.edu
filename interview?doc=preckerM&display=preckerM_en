            As we learn subsequently, although the Germans occupied Paris in June 1940, Mrs. Precker narrowly escaped arrest in July 1942 and was arrested with her family in June 1944 in the city of Cannes.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_2"></a>
            On July 16th and 17th in 1942, some 4,500 French policemen rounded  up a total of 12,884 mostly foreign-born Jews in Paris who had not become naturalized French citizens. Nearly 10,000 of those arrested were women and children. Although Mrs. Precker saved herself by bribing the two French policemen who came to arrest her, the fact that she was a French-born Jew might have played a role in her release. Few of those arrested in the July roundup survived.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_3"></a>
            Like Nice, Cannes was formerly in the Italian-occupied zone of southeastern France. Until the collapse of the Italian fascist government and the withdrawal of Italian troops from the zone in September 1943, some 50,000 Jews, among them the Mrs. Precker and her family, had sought refuge there. Most refugees, like Mrs. Precker and her family, at first went to the city of Nice. After the departure of Italian troops, the family moved to Cannes.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_4"></a>
            Given the fact that Mrs. Precker and her family arrived in Drancy at the beginning of August 1944, they must have spent over a month in the two prisons in Nice.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_5"></a>
            Despite the Allied landings in Normandy on June 6, 1944 and the increase in resistance activity throughout the country, deportation of Jews to the infamous Drancy camp in the suburbs of Paris continued, as did deportations from Drancy to Auschwitz. A convoy of some 1,300 Drancy internees left for Auschwitz on July 31, 1944. Mrs. Precker and her family narrowly missed sharing their fate.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_6"></a>
            This must have occurred subsequent to the German occupation of Nice that began the evening of September 8, 1943. Two days later Alois Brunner, Adolf Eichmann's deputy, and highly trained SS police entered Nice and began a brutal roundup of Jews which, however, was inhibited by the lack of cooperation by many non-Jewish French men and women.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_7"></a>
            It is not clear from Mrs. Precker's testimony what sort of papers these were, but they raised German suspicions of a link between her father and their English enemy.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_8"></a>
            They were probably told that they were going to be sent to Germany for forced labor and that their family would be kept together for the sake of family unity, whereas in reality they would have been sent to Auschwitz. The Germans regularly used deceptive techniques to hide the "Final Solution" from their victims.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_9"></a>
            Even as the Allies closed in on Paris in the first two weeks of August 1944, Alois Brunner, the Nazi fanatic who had turned Drancy into an SS-controlled concentration camp in 1943, continued his efforts to deport Jews to Auschwitz, including Mrs. Precker and her family. Fortunately, he did not succeed, and on the morning of Thursday, August 17, he turned the camp over to the German army and fled.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_10"></a>
            The establishment of this school in the midst of such a squalid and dangerous environment may be considered a form of resistance. Solidarity and mutual help characterized the Drancy camp population.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_11"></a>
            Mrs. Precker is referring here to the vermin that infested the mattresses and the rest of the camp.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_12"></a>
            On the afternoon of August 17, 1944, the German army turned Drancy over to Raoul Nordling, the Consul General of neutral Sweden. Nordling then asked the French Red Cross to care for the camp's inmates, although they did not leave Drancy until about one week later.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_13"></a>
            It is not clear from Mrs. Precker's testimony whether this prisoner exchange actually took place.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_14"></a>
            It is also not clear why the Germans placed this family in the apartment of Mrs. Precker and her family, which must have been in an upscale neighborhood in Paris. Mrs. Precker does indicate that the family was friendly to the Germans in some way and so might have been part of the collaborationist Vichy regime.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_15"></a>
            It should not be forgotten that the Nazis were among the greatest plunderers in modern history. They not only took their victims' lives but their possessions as well.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_16"></a>
            The Americans entered Paris on August 25, 1944, the official date of the liberation of the city.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_17"></a>
            Mrs. Precker and her family were among the 1,542 lice-ridden, famished and terrified Jews living under constant threat of deportation who were liberated from Drancy.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_18"></a>
            Mrs. Precker might be referring here to the UGIF (Union Générale des Israélites de France) the controversial body which, under the Vichy regime, was the sole government-recognized Jewish representative organization.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_19"></a>
            Mrs. Precker and her family had the authority of the victorious Free French forces behind them.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_20"></a>
            Mrs. Precker means that if the apartments were occupied by people from areas surrounding Paris who had had their homes destroyed, she believes that they were able to at least temporarily remain in the apartments they had lived in during the German occupation. In the postwar period, French Jewry had only partial success in reclaiming the apartments and businesses of those who had been deported.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_21"></a>
            Since Mrs. Precker previously indicated that her daughter was eleven years old in 1944, and this interview took place in August 1946, her account is inconsistent in this regard.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_22"></a>
            "College" here means secondary school.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_23"></a>
            It is not clear what kind of work Mrs. Precker was doing for the Joint and whether or not it was paid or volunteer work. In any case, Mrs. Precker was working for an organization which at the time was providing invaluable aid to survivors of Nazi tyranny.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_24"></a>
            As Boder indicates, some French men and women during the years of German occupation behaved with cruelty or cold indifference, while others demonstrated compassion and selflessness. In the immediate postwar period, however, the myth of France as a nation of resisters, apart from a few collaborators and traitors, predominated.

                The camp was opened after a roundup of in Paris Jews in August, 1941, in which over 4000 Jews were arrested.  Drancy was under the control of the French police until July 3, 1943 when Nazi Germany took day-to-day control as part of the major stepping up at all facilities for the mass exterminations.

            As we learn subsequently, although the Germans occupied Paris in June 1940, Mrs. Precker narrowly escaped arrest in July 1942 and was arrested with her family in June 1944 in the city of Cannes.

            On July 16th and 17th in 1942, some 4,500 French policemen rounded  up a total of 12,884 mostly foreign-born Jews in Paris who had not become naturalized French citizens. Nearly 10,000 of those arrested were women and children. Although Mrs. Precker saved herself by bribing the two French policemen who came to arrest her, the fact that she was a French-born Jew might have played a role in her release. Few of those arrested in the July roundup survived.

            Like Nice, Cannes was formerly in the Italian-occupied zone of southeastern France. Until the collapse of the Italian fascist government and the withdrawal of Italian troops from the zone in September 1943, some 50,000 Jews, among them the Mrs. Precker and her family, had sought refuge there. Most refugees, like Mrs. Precker and her family, at first went to the city of Nice. After the departure of Italian troops, the family moved to Cannes.

            Despite the Allied landings in Normandy on June 6, 1944 and the increase in resistance activity throughout the country, deportation of Jews to the infamous Drancy camp in the suburbs of Paris continued, as did deportations from Drancy to Auschwitz. A convoy of some 1,300 Drancy internees left for Auschwitz on July 31, 1944. Mrs. Precker and her family narrowly missed sharing their fate.

            This must have occurred subsequent to the German occupation of Nice that began the evening of September 8, 1943. Two days later Alois Brunner, Adolf Eichmann's deputy, and highly trained SS police entered Nice and began a brutal roundup of Jews which, however, was inhibited by the lack of cooperation by many non-Jewish French men and women.

            They were probably told that they were going to be sent to Germany for forced labor and that their family would be kept together for the sake of family unity, whereas in reality they would have been sent to Auschwitz.

            Even as the Allies closed in on Paris in the first two weeks of August 1944, Alois Brunner, the Nazi fanatic who had turned Drancy into an SS-controlled concentration camp in 1943, continued his efforts to deport Jews to Auschwitz, including Mrs. Precker and her family. Fortunately, he did not succeed, and on the morning of Thursday, August 17, he turned the camp over to the German army and fled.

            On the afternoon of August 17, 1944, the German army turned Drancy over to Raoul Nordling, the Consul General of neutral Sweden. Nordling then asked the French Red Cross to care for the camp's inmates, although they did not leave Drancy until about one week later.

            Mrs. Precker and her family had the authority of the victorious Free French forces behind them.

            Mrs. Precker means that if the apartments were occupied by people from areas surrounding Paris who had had their homes destroyed, she believes that they were able to at least temporarily remain in the apartments they had lived in during the German occupation. In the postwar period, French Jewry had only partial success in reclaiming the apartments and businesses of those who had been deported.

            Since Mrs. Precker previously indicated that her daughter was eleven years old in 1944, and this interview took place in August 1946, her account is inconsistent in this regard.

            It is not clear what kind of work Mrs. Precker was doing for the Joint and whether or not it was paid or volunteer work. In any case, Mrs. Precker was working for an organization which at the time was providing invaluable aid to survivors of Nazi tyranny.

            As Boder indicates, some French men and women during the years of German occupation behaved with cruelty or cold indifference, while others demonstrated compassion and selflessness. In the immediate postwar period, however, the myth of France as a nation of resisters, apart from a few collaborators and traitors, predominated.
