Then all the Jews from <a class="placename" href="#vothL76">Kovno</a>, most of then about 90 per cent of the Jews, wanted to run away with the Red Army into Russia. Unfortunately only a small part managed to run with the Russians, to reach Russia. The rest had to turn around back towards <a class="placename" href="#vothL76">Kovno</a>. And on the roads... on the roads along which the Jews had to return to <a class="placename" href="#vothL76">Kovno</a> stood already Lithuanian <a class="term" href="#vothG_partisans">partisans</a>, that means Lithuanian hirelings who were in the service of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a>, well ready, and they were catching the Jews and leading them to the seventh fortress, not far from <a class="placename" href="#vothL76">Kovno</a> [see below] and there they were shot en masse. And so it started ... the war had started on Sunday and Wednesday night the Lithuanians... Wednesday night the Lithuanians made a <a class="term" href="#vothG_pogrom">pogrom</a> in Slabodka, that is a suburb of <a class="placename" href="#vothL76">Kovno</a>. There they murdered Wednesday night and Thursday night, it was the first of the month Tammuz, they massacred about 3,000 Jews. For instance, the rabbi of Slabodka, the first murdered while he was sitting over a book of the Talmud. They then cut off his head and exhibited it in the window.</span>

That is, before 1914, a kind of fortifications, and there they led all the Jews to be shot. And so we lived about for a week, a Jew in general couldn't show himself on the street. That is officially, he could come out on the streets but as soon as he would show up they would grab him and lead him to the fort to be shot.

At that time there was not yet organized a proper work authority, that is, the Jewish representatives which were to be in charge about work, that is, who should go to work; and so it came about that the Jews themselves had to help to grab, to gather together the five hundred and thirty Jews, and they grabbed together not five hundred and thirty but five hundred and thirty-four so that four went for good measure. And they were led away and so it came seven o'clock in the evening and the people were not back and none of them showed up the next morning and up to the last day that we were in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> the fate of these people remained a mystery. Obviously, we understood that they were not alive, but exactly we didn't know. But when the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> was evacuated in â44, when the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> was evacuated to Germany, Dr. Elkes, before he died--he died in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>--Dr. Elkes revealed that he was told the next morning by Gerke, who was with the district commissar the deputy for Jewish affairs, a German about 21 years of age, a teacher of physical education, he confided in him that the Jews were shot. And when Dr. Elkes asked why, he said that because fifty-three Jews worked during the first days for the Germans on sugar, and since fifty-three bags of sugar were somewhat damaged five hundred and thirty Jews had to pay for it with the four additional ones thrown in. Also that happened on Monday the seventeenth of August, 1941 [about this massacre of the intellectuals of <a class="placename" href="#vothL76">Kovno</a> see a remark at the end of the interview]. On Tuesday the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> was heavily surrounded and the Germans en masse were admitted to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a>. And they started looting, that is, robbing the homes. They would enter a home and first demand the surrender of the gold and silver and diamonds and watches, and then order to open all the closets and valises; and they took out the better things and took them for themselves. They also took away the better pieces of furniture and carted them away to the city for themselves. And later mass shootings occurred in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a>. The law was that if a Jew sees a German from a distance he has to take off his hat and greet him with good morning irrespective whether the German found it necessary to respond; and if the Jew would not happen to notice him exactly at three, four meters ahead and take off his hat, he was immediately shot. This all was just a preparation, it was just a prelude to the subsequent occurences. Soon afterwards there was issued an order, an official order signed by the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a>, that all Jews within a week's time are to surrender all gold, silver, diamonds, money, and may keep only 100 rubles. You see, at that time the ruble still was circulating, the mark and the ruble. The ruble was... ten rubles were worth one mark. And one could have only 100 rubles. That is, the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> was impoverished so that they should not have anything to live on further, and all better things, even underwear they also had... there was issued an order that they must be surrendered and all electrical appliances had to be surrendered, and those... and then it was announced that those who will not surrender [their things] at the designated time will be shot. And for the purpose that people should believe them they previously arranged the mass shootings just for trifles or for nothing; they would shoot so that people should believe them that executions are their established practice.

It was clearly stated in the Jewish religion--and that in spite that Dr. Elkes wasn't a specially pious Jew--but still he was a nation conscious Jew and also a <a class="term" href="#vothG_zionist">Zionist</a>, he told him that it is stated in the Jewish religion to deliver Jews for execution is prohibited. Even in the case if they are being threatened that they all will be shot, they all should submit to being shot rather than deliver one Jew to the shooting. And then Koslowski told Dr. Elkes: "If you will not deliver 500, I shall take more than 500." And Dr. Elkes replied, "It may cost [the lives of] all 45,000 Jews in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> but I shall not deliver to you any Jews to be shot. This happened on Thursday... the conversation took place Friday early in the morning, that is, he claimed that they shot at him in the night from Thursday to Friday, and on Friday already, an half an hour after the conversation took place, many Lithuanians and Germans, that is, the same Lithuanians who were in the service of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a>, marched in into the <a class="placename" href="#vothC50" type="camp">ghetto</a>; one <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a> of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> was cut off and all the Jews [from this <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">block</a>] were led out to a square and there whoever had a card, that was called a Jordan card, that is, a card of an artisan which was issued a month earlier [there seems to have occured some interruption, possibly a break in the wire during reproduction.

And standing in the <a class="placename" href="#vothC50" type="camp">ghetto</a> one could see how the people were led on the hill. And afterwards, I was that day in the city working for the Lithuanians, doing compulsory labor, and by about four o'clock, I didn't know a thing about it, by about four o'clock I saw the Lithuanians coming drunk carrying Jewish things. I recognized that these were Jewish things because there was a whole truckload of things and on the things [clothing] were the patches, the yellow patches. And I asked the Lithuanians, "How did you get these Jewish clothes and overcoats?" so they replied that there was an <a class="term" href="#vothG_action">action</a> in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a>, that is, by <a class="term" href="#vothG_action">action</a> was meant an event when the Jews were taken to be shot. [The term <a class="term" href="#vothG_action">action</a> was a common term in ghettos and concentration camps and meant mass selections either for deportation or execution.] And so that was the first <a class="term" href="#vothG_action">action</a>; afterwards the fourth of September, 1941, it happened... there came the Germans... there were in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a>, I want to note that within the <a class="placename" href="#vothC50" type="camp">ghetto</a>... there were two <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a>; a little <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> and a large <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a>. And the little <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> was seperated from the large <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> by a bridge because a ditch [?] cut through between the two <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> and the Germans, reserving the by-pass for themselves, made a bridge for the Jews to cross from one <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> to the other. That day they came to the <a class="placename" href="#vothC50" type="camp">ghetto</a>, and they put up a German guard on the bridge and the word was passed that no Jew could enter from the large <a class="placename" href="#vothC50" type="camp">ghetto</a> into the little one, from the little <a class="placename" href="#vothC50" type="camp">ghetto</a> into the large one, and they led away the whole little <a class="placename" href="#vothC50" type="camp">ghetto</a>; first they proceeded... there was the hospital of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a>, there they first set fire to the hospital with the people and with the doctors all together. That is, with the sick, with the doctors together, and they set fire to it. Also, the same morning early, they set fire to the children's home which they [the previous authorities] were unable to evacuate to Russia, the Jewish children's home, the one-time home of the orphans named after the <a class="placename" href="#vothL76">Kovno</a> rabbi Arav Reb Itzkhok Khonon [I am not sure of the names.] And to this, too, they set fire to the children alive and to all the sick in the hospital. And then they led out the Jews from the small <a class="placename" href="#vothC50" type="camp">ghetto</a> to a square and again sorted them according to the Jordan cards.

I, too, registered as a skilled worker, an electrician, and at the time when I was summoned to get my card I didn't know whether that was good or not. For example, they asked me of how many people does my family consist. I replied that I am alone in spite of the fact that I had already a wife, and a mother with eight chil... [the word children has not been finished] brothers and sisters. And they tell me: "But you also have a mother?" so I said that my mother was dead.

And all the property of the little <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> was given away, the Germans took for themselves, but the locality they did not yet take for themselves, and they left the place fenced around from all sides and nobody was permitted to live there, neither a Lithuanian not a Jew. All that... from the beginning all that was incomprehensible, but later it became clear that that was a preparation for the great <a class="term" href="#vothG_action">action</a>. So now we go over to the third <a class="term" href="#vothG_action">action</a>. We don't count what happened in between, lesser shooting [incidents] and so on. And so the 28th of October, 1941, I will repeat 1941, that is, in the same year in the first few months. The 27th of October, 1941, in the evening, it was announced on the streets that all Jews, men and women, children and the old ones and sick ones have tomorrow, the 28th of October, starting at six o'clock in the morning, to report, to assemble on the big square, that is, between the three great buildings, <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">Block</a> A, <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">Block</a> B, <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">Block</a> C, at the Square of Democracy. And there they all have to assemble, and this order I have still with me because with me remained the archives of the <a class="placename" href="#vothC50" type="camp">Kovno ghetto</a>, [and the order] read that whoever... that the German police will go later searching the homes, and whoever will have remained at home will be shot. The order instructed that only sick people who are unable to get up from bed will remain in the house but there should be a sign on the door saying that upstairs in such and such a room there is a sick person. And in the order it was also said that everything has to remain open, the doors, the wardrobes, the valises, everything is to remain open. And so the Jews started the next morning, on October 28th, by six o'clock to assemble on the big square, and an hour later, that is, at seven o'clock in the morning, the square, regardless that the square was located within the <a class="placename" href="#vothC50" type="camp">ghetto</a>, was again surrounded by German guards and with Lithuanians, and it was ordered that people should assemble each according to his place of work, in the way how they were designated to work [I am not sure that this last passage is exactly correct].

And at this gate there stood Jordan with the whole gang and the elders... and the Committee, or how it was called, the "council of the elders" marched through without control, that is, all of them passed through. And here I want to remark: the world knows that left is worse then right. All those--at the former two <a class="term" href="#vothG_action">actions</a>--the people who were led to be shot would be led... would be separated at the left. But this time, in order to confuse the minds, that is, to confuse the Jews, the multitude, they yelled to the Council of the Elders, "Left," and it was assumed that the council of elders, the Jewish Committee, is being led to be shot. Afterwards they passed through the Jewish police, also with their families without control, and the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> brigade without control [by control he apparently means individual checkup], and the Jordan brigade [passed] without control and then... when all that was over they yelled: "And now, the airfield, step forward." With the airfield they started already to classify, that is, they were sorting them out. He stood there with the rest of the gang. Half a day he stood there alone, Jordan, and looked into everybody's face. And who looked younger, he went left, that is to live. And he who looked older was driven across the square to the right. First it was not known what it all meant, right or left. Afterwards when on the right side there were congregated on the right side several hundred or possibly a few thousand Jews, he gave an order to the German guards to lead them away. It revealed itself that they were led away to the former little <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a>, which as I remarked before had remained empty. There they held the people and so it was going on during the whole day without letdown. The one who looked younger, the one who was better dressed, without many children, or not an old man--he went to the left. And the one who was badly dressed, with more children, etc.--he went to the right and until the twilight when he noticed that he won't be able to sort out the forty-four thousand Jews, he would let pass entire parties of about one hundred sending them to the right, and [then] one hundred to the left. Then it could happen, then it happened that younger ones happened to fall in among those to be shot and some older ones fell in [into the group] to remain alive, because he was unable to continue with the classification, he saw that darkness was already falling and so...</span>

I want to point out that the trick was not only to show that in such and such building there is a maline but they had to show how one could get in into the maline so that it could not be found. And they [the Jewish policemen] showed them how to get in, and they took out from there the old ones and the little children and all were led away to the fort and were shot. The police...</span>

However, it revealed itself that they were our enemies. In the moment when their own lives were in peril they preferred to sacrifice [Here he uses the term beat Kapores; this is a ritual performed on the morning before the day of atonement and consists in offering â now symbolically the life of a hen or a rooster â instead of one's own life which one presumably deserves to be taken in expiation of his sins.] the lives of other Jews so that they could remain alive. And then they discovered and ransacked all malines, literally all malines of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a>, and all hidden children were dragged out. I want to state that forty per cent of the children remained hidden in the ghetto after all, that is, the children hidden in the malines did not remain alive in spite of it, while children who were hidden in lesser [less safe] places, under a bed or tucked in in a bed remained alive against expectations. And in the evening the <a class="term" href="#vothG_action">action</a> was over and the results of the second day were much worse than the first, that means they were much worse than the first, that means they were better for the Germans, but for us Jews the results were still worse, that is, there were many more victims the second day than the first day. I want to state that when the children were found, many mothers wanted to go with the children together, because it was announced that the children will be shot, but the Germans would not grant it to the Jewish mothers [the expression sounds as if the Germans could not see them having this pleasure], and they said, for instance â they took away a child from one of my sisters â and she pleaded to be allowed to go together with the child, so he [the German] said: "Well, you still have to work, you still can live, your turn will also come," [the words of the German were given in correct German] that is: "Your turn will come but for the time being you still must work."</span>
