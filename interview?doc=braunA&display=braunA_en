September 20, 1946, <a class="placename" href="#vothL29">Munich</a> at the Funkenkaserne in a displaced persons camp of about 5,000 persons, an immense installation of the former German army which apparently was occupied by the signal corps. Though the windows I see children playing, like children play everywhere. They play all sorts of games, under the directions of teachers or by themselves, There are rows and rows of barracks. My interviewee is Mrs. Anna Braun, who is here with a group of about 500 Mennonites. They live together in one block which I intend to visit later, men and women together as one community and in one large room, separated as I am told by some kind of tent material and sleeping in wide two level bunks, often a different family on each level. The interview proceeds in German.<note n="1"><span class="note">The origin of the Mennonites can be traced to the 16th century Anabaptist movement. Menno Simons, a Dutch religious leader, united the scattered Anabaptist congregations of northern Europe that became called by his name.</span><sup><a href="#note_1">1</a></sup></note></span>

During the time we were still in Russia the Jews were taken away by the Germans and many German soldiers were telling us what they were doing to the Jews. We even had such a case. In general the Mennonites are not permitted to marry outside of their group from among other people, from other religions. But because among us one Mennonite woman had married a Jew so she had a child from that Jew. So I know this story for example definitely for certain. About the other things I just know from hearsay, what happened to the Jews and one wouldn't know should believe it, things were really so horrible. But about this woman from whom they have taken away the child because it had a Jew for its father and that the child was killed, that we know, and we knew through it what they have been doing to the Jews[she begins to sob] The child was poisoned.<note n="26"><span class="note">Indeed, the crimes of the Holocaust were so despicable and so irrational as to be initially "beyond belief" even for many Jews.</span><sup><a href="#note_26">26</a></sup></note></span>

After we have given all our possessions to the lawyers that they should try everything in order to at least have the death sentence commuted. In this we succeeded and the sentence was commuted to twenty-five years imprisonement. However, in two years my brother died in prison.<note n="30"><span class="note">The Cheka, OGPU, NKVD, MVD and KGB were all acronyms for the Soviet secret police.</span><sup><a href="#note_30">30</a></sup></note></span>

            This was just prior to the 1937-38 Great Terror, years of mass arrests and executions which spread from the communist party hierarchy throughout Soviet society. From 1918 on, however, mass arrests, deportations, incarcerations and executions had taken place in the Soviet Union. The arrest rate among Mennonites was considerably higher than that for the general population.

            False charges of sabotage and/or espionage were used to get rid of so-called enemies of the state who could also be blamed for production shortages or bureaucratic malfeasance or incompetence.

            In fact, the Mennonite communities of the Zaporozhye district were under control of the Germans for two years. The German defeat at the epic battle of Stalingrad in the winter of 1943 marked the turning point in the war with the Soviet Union. This was followed by the German defeat in the battle of Kursk in July-August, 1943. From then on the Red army was on the offensive.

            Mrs. Braun describes an unpleasant and arduous rail journey, but one that was markedly better than the deadly rail journey taken by Jews to extermination centers.

            Mrs. Braun is confusing Litzmannstadt (what she terms Lipmanstadt), the German name for ÅÃ³dÅº, with L'viv (Ger. Lemberg), a large industrial and cultural center in western Ukraine. Of a Jewish community of 110,000 at the start of the war, only a handful of the Jews of L'viv remained alive at liberation.

            Neustadt (German for "new town") is the name for a number of towns in Germany. The northern German city of Neustadt where Mrs. Braun and her daughters were interned is now in Poland along with the nearby city of Danzig, now Gdansk.

            These were undoubtedly forced labor workers whom the Nazis deported to work in German war industries. They were not exterminated like Jews and Gypsies (Roma) but were conscripted against their will and lived under the trying conditions Mrs. Braun describes.

            Koenigsberg was then in East Prussia. Today it has been renamed Kaliningrad and is under Russian control. Though on the Baltic, it is considerably east of Danzig (Gdansk).

            At the time it was not known as Czechoslovakia. The Czech portions of prewar Czechoslovakia had been taken over by the Germans and renamed the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Slovakia became a Nazi puppet state.

            Nazi collaborators, such as the Swedish engineer described by Mrs. Braun, assisted them in their nefarious undertakings. They were motivated by various factors such as attraction to Nazi ideology or material gain. Since the Swedes were neutral in World War II, Larson was indeed, as Mrs. Braun points out, a willing collaborator. At the time, he was the leader (fuehrer) of the group.

            The post traumatic stress exhibited by Mrs. Braun was due to her harrowing experiences both prior to and during the war. Understandably, it was not uncommon among postwar refugees.

            The indifference of the majority of the German population to the heinous crimes of the Nazis, especially the Holocaust, was a major enabling factor.

            The Mennonites and some other Protestant sects regarded the Jews as "the apple of God's eyes" due their regard for and understanding of the Hebrew Bible.

            Indeed, the crimes of the Holocaust were so despicable and so irrational as to be initially "beyond belief" even for many Jews.

            It is unclear how the baby was murdered, but the Germans used all sorts of deceptions and diabolical methods in carrying out their murderous actions.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.

            This was just prior to the 1937-38 Great Terror, years of mass arrests and executions which spread from the communist party hierarchy throughout Soviet society. From 1918 on, however, mass arrests, deportations, incarcerations and executions had taken place in the Soviet Union. The arrest rate among Mennonites was considerably higher than that for the general population.

The German defeat at the epic battle of Stalingrad in the winter of 1943 marked the turning point in the war with the Soviet Union. This was followed by the German defeat in the battle of Kursk in July-August, 1943. From then on the Red army was on the offensive.
