            Translator's note: Breslauer uses the German words "Effektenh√§ndler" and "Wertpapierh√§ndler," which in today's usage are more or less equivalent. In contemporary usage, however, the term "Effekten" may have had a slightly different field of reference.

            Following the German occupation of Hungary, a series of decrees brought about the isolation, marking, plundering and ghettoization of the Jewish population. Deportation of Jews from the Hungarian provinces to Auschwitz began on May 15, 1944. From then until July 9th, 1944 when the deportations were halted, 434,351 Jews were deported. Most were murdered in the gas chambers of Auschwitz-Birkenau upon arrival. During this time, the Jews of Budapest, the Hungarian capital, were spared.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_3"></a>
            The deceptive practices of the Nazis in combination with the naivet√© of the potential victims contributed to a tragic outcome.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_4"></a>
            The transport ostensibly left for neutral Spain or Switzerland but was diverted to Bergen-Belsen.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_5"></a>
            Breslauer is referring here to Rudolf Kasztner. He is obviously and understandably a staunch defender of the Kasztner plan.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_6"></a>
            Boder repeatedly mispronounces "Bergen-Belsen" as "Belsen-Belsen."
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_7"></a>
            The train ride Breslauer describes was no doubt terribly trying, yet it cannot compare with the nightmarish rail journeys taken by several million Jews to extermination centers on which the old and the very young often perished before the journey's end.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_8"></a>
            A so-called Hungarian camp was established at Bergen-Belsen on July 8, 1944 to hold the Jews of the Kasztner transport. The prisoners were allowed to wear their own clothes but also had to display the yellow badge. As noted by Breslauer, they were not made to do forced labor and did not have to subsist on starvation rations.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_9"></a>
            Breslauer might be referring here to Jews from Romanian and Yugoslavian territories, northern Transylvania and Backa respectively, annexed by German-allied Hungary in 1940 and 1941.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_10"></a>
            The second Kasztner transport actually left from Bergen-Belsen for Switzerland on December 6, 1944.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_11"></a>
            In the SS, an Obergruppenf√ºhrer (literally, "Senior Group Leader") was the equivalent of a general. Here, the term is most probably used by Breslauer to refer to a high-ranking SS officer.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_12"></a>
            This was the transport sent from Bergen-Belsen to Switzerland on August 18, 1944.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_13"></a>
            Kolozsv√°r, also known as Cluj, was the capital of Hungarian-ruled northern Transylvania. It had a number of politically active Zionist leaders including Rudolf Kasztner. Kasztner visited Kolozsv√°r on May 4th and 5th, 1944. Shortly thereafter, 388 Jews, including many of his relatives and friends, were transported from the city's ghetto to Budapest where they became part of the Kasztner transport.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_14"></a>
            Breslauer might be referring here to the Hungarian Zionist movement's Relief and Rescue Committee in which Kasztner and several other Jews from Transylvania played a role.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_15"></a>
            In fact, this exchange for war-related goods never took place due to the opposition of Allied governments.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_16"></a>
            Indeed, Kasztner saw the transport he organized as an initial effort to rescue Jews. He hoped, in vain as it turned out, that it would set a precedent for subsequent transports.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_17"></a>
            Translator's note: The German original uses "verpediert." Even though it sounds like a German participle, no such word exists in German. What he means, probably, is "searched" or "frisked."
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_18"></a>
            Although neutral Switzerland took in Jews from the Kasztner transport and some other Jewish refugees as well, Swiss officialdom was on the whole hostile to Jews seeking refuge in their country and, both before and during the war, abandoned to their fate many thousands fleeing for their lives.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_19"></a>
            Major international Jewish organizations such as the Joint, World Jewish Congress and the He-Halutz Zionist body had branches in Geneva, Switzerland. They engaged in rescue and relief efforts on behalf of European Jewry.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_20"></a>
            Breslauer is referring to Bergen-Belsen's "star camp," so-called because inmates could wear their own clothing but had to wear a yellow badge. The "star camp" was the largest of the five satellite Belsen camps and was located next to the camp in which Breslauer and his family were lodged. Most of the prisoners in the "star camp" were Jews from the Netherlands. They were classified as "exchange Jews," ostensibly designated for potential exchange for German nationals under Allied rule whom the Germans wished to repatriate.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_21"></a>
            In German, "Juden√§ltester."
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_22"></a>
            Translator's note: Literally, something like a reception hall. "Auffang" in combination with "lager" usually refers to a refugee's camp. Breslauer probably means a room, or a hall, in which refugees were received and housed.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_23"></a>
            Since Mrs. Breslauer's maiden name is not indicated, the identity of her father could not be determined.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_24"></a>
            Like so many other survivors, the Breslauers were diligently preparing to begin new postwar lives.

                Established in the spring of 1943 and initially intended as a transit camp, it soon was integrated into the concentration camp network.  Its population swelled late in the war as inmates from other camps further east were moved into it--from around 15,000 in late 1944 to 41,250 in March 1945.

            Following the German occupation of Hungary, a series of decrees brought about the isolation, marking, plundering and ghettoization of the Jewish population. Deportation of Jews from the Hungarian provinces to Auschwitz began on May 15, 1944. From then until July 9th, 1944 when the deportations were halted, 434,351 Jews were deported. Most were murdered in the gas chambers of Auschwitz-Birkenau upon arrival. During this time, the Jews of Budapest, the Hungarian capital, were spared.

            The train ride Breslauer describes was no doubt terribly trying, yet it cannot compare with the nightmarish rail journeys taken by several million Jews to extermination centers on which the old and the very young often perished before the journey's end.

            A so-called Hungarian camp was established at Bergen-Belsen on July 8, 1944 to hold the Jews of the Kasztner transport. The prisoners were allowed to wear their own clothes but also had to display the yellow badge. As noted by Breslauer, they were not made to do forced labor and did not have to subsist on starvation rations.

            In the SS, an Obergruppenf√ºhrer (literally, "Senior Group Leader") was the equivalent of a general. Here, the term is most probably used by Breslauer to refer to a high-ranking SS officer.

            Kolozsv√°r, also known as Cluj, was the capital of Hungarian-ruled northern Transylvania. It had a number of politically active Zionist leaders including Rudolf Kasztner. Kasztner visited Kolozsv√°r on May 4th and 5th, 1944. Shortly thereafter, 388 Jews, including many of his relatives and friends, were transported from the city's ghetto to Budapest where they became part of the Kasztner transport.

            Indeed, Kasztner saw the transport he organized as an initial effort to rescue Jews. He hoped, in vain as it turned out, that it would set a precedent for subsequent transports.

            Although neutral Switzerland took in Jews from the Kasztner transport and some other Jewish refugees as well, Swiss officialdom was on the whole hostile to Jews seeking refuge in their country and, both before and during the war, abandoned to their fate many thousands fleeing for their lives.

            Breslauer is referring to Bergen-Belsen's "star camp," so-called because inmates could wear their own clothing but had to wear a yellow badge. The "star camp" was the largest of the five satellite Belsen camps and was located next to the camp in which Breslauer and his family were lodged. Most of the prisoners in the "star camp" were Jews from the Netherlands. They were classified as "exchange Jews," ostensibly designated for potential exchange for German nationals under Allied rule whom the Germans wished to repatriate.
