This time one is unable to wiggle himself out because it was said that if the man will not present himself they will take the families and the children. And so I assembled a bundle for my husband. Various small things, underwear, and such things and a lot of neighbors from Pelmont all were sitting around and it was said on that night that those who have not presented themselves -- they will come and take them from the homes by force. Frenchmen. We were sitting there. The children slept in a kind of a vestibule -- a large room like here, in the vestibule. And my husband and I were sitting like here, at the window. It was already one; it was already two o'clock. We wanted to see what was going to happen. As I sit so with my husband we hear the gates opening and there enter about twenty motorcyclists with revolvers, <a class="term" href="#vothG_gendarme">gendarmes</a>, police, inspectors, all Frenchmen. We saw no Germans. And they spread out over the four corners of the yard, all of them. Five or six men went up into each stairway. Soon the gates were shut and they started going from door to door. Ouvre la porte! We are doomed. They came in. They came in. So I thought that they have come to take my husband. And as if an angel had pushed my hand, I say to my husband, "You know what? I shall tell them that you are not here. Let them do what they want. They won't take me and the children. Certainly not. I will tell them that you are sick, that you are away in some hospital:, and the call: "Madame F."</span>

I immediately fainted. But I pulled myself together so that my husband should not come out from hiding. And he stood in the corner by the door hidden well. I pulled myself together. The children, hearing it, started crying, and they all came into the room. "Mama, what are you doing?" And I said, "Yes, my child, the time has come. We have to go." [Here is a long pause and she weeps bitterly. Fully three sentences are not understandable due to loud and violent sobbing.] It was four o'clock in the morning.

[The next sentence isn't clear; she is still sobbing. The best I can get is, "We have to go, to go to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>."] Just like this. One of them was nineteen. The second was sixteen years old. The boy was twelve years old and the little girl was eight years old. And there stood two inspectors and two policemen and they told us, "Take with you this, and take with you that, because you probably will have to be in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> for a long time and it will be cold there.

The door was shut and my heart felt like an iron bolt. Everything left behind. Each with a bundle on his shoulder and that is how we left home. When we got out into the yard we found about forty families sitting with their bundles. Small ones, grown-ups, mothers with children, old people, everybody was here. So I said to my neighbors: "See, we are meeting all together." "Yes", they say, "Time has come and we must go." We did not believe what the Germans refugees were telling us, and what the Austrian refugees told us. We considered the German people as people who have a bit of human heart, but now we see that everything they told us is true because they have experienced it before. They led us away to the comissariat for registration. In a large "shop" [she uses the word shop] the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gendarme">gendarmes</a>, the police, the inspectors were working [with sarcasm] very efficiently. They did their work better even than the Germans have told them. Loyally. Frenchmen and Frenchwomen stood around, and around. All were rejoicing. The Jews are being taken away.

She dragged the bundles. She got a hold of some straw that was lying around on the sides prepared for the people and she fixed a "lay-down." "Here, mother", she said, "here we will lie down and we shall sleep over the night." It was very hard to find some room. People were lying almost one over the other.

[Mockingly] It was not their fault, the Germans were doing it.

They carried away about five hundred dead, people who just died. The aged, the sick, the chronically ill, they couldn't stand it for more than a day or two. If they come into a house and lead out a person who has been lying sick and they take him away, where are they taking him away? -- To die! Just driven like sheep with a stave. Five hundred people, men, women, children died during these five days and in that whole place they had altogether two physicians who were ministering to 50,000 people.</span>

They would deal with the people just as if these people had no business to be alive anymore. Hurry up, a tap with a stick and that is all. There were a few nurses because the people were very excited. Every time when a woman or a child would raise their voice crying the whole velodrom, as many as there were, could cry with them. The destruction of the temple! I personally could not cry any more. I had on my heart a sheet of iron. It wasn't that I had courage. I simply was prostrated. The children would bring a bit of water, a bit of tea, and so we remained there all these days. Every day some people were selected and went away. By and by, some to <a class="placename" href="#vothC88" type="camp">Pithiviers</a>, some to <a class="placename" href="#vothC27" type="camp">Drancy</a>. Those with children to <a class="placename" href="#vothC88" type="camp">Pithiviers</a>. Single persons to <a class="placename" href="#vothC27" type="camp">Drancy</a>. One who has not gone through the velodrom Iviere personally cannot imagine what was going on there. It is impossible Monsieur Professor, to present a picture of the events. Impossible. Impossible to make a picture of it. One had to have iron strength and a heart of a beast, of a horse. Words are of no avail. Meanwhile my husband succeeded to get out of the apartment and he hurried to a good friend of his who worked for the Germans. A furrier, who made fur coats for the winter, such little fur vests. And this one had the right to get out women and children from the velodrom whom the French had arrested. And there was a large "microphone" [Footnote: She of course refers to an address system.] in the middle of the place on the velodrom, and there they called out the names. Those families who were arrested whose men worked for the Germans and had certificates, certificates, those would be set free immediately. They were ordered to be set free. Here I saw they set free a family one day, then the next day a lot of families are being set free, and here I am very weak, and I say to my children, "Children, go to the microphone. Maybe our name too will be called. Maybe Father has done something for us. He has a good friend who works for the Germans; maybe he has gone to see him, maybe he has asked him" So they gave our name reversed.</span>

That is the way they led us. During the five days at the velodrom the place was terribly dirty. One didn't see any water for washing purposes. The toilets (if you excuse me) had overrun. There stood around a lot of acquaintances who were not arrested, with bundles -- all around the gates, to send in food for the children. But the Frenchmen fired at them and did not permit a single bundle to pass into the velodrom for the people. And as many people that came there with bundles for the unfortunate people, those who still remained free all had to go back. They were all driven away. Not a crum was permitted to pass. The people who were already there do not have to eat. They are doomed. Do you understand? That was all. And they have to return. They have spent heavy money and everything got spoiled, perished, and they had to throw it out and the French did not admit into the velodrom even an ounce of bread, and no food, and that was during the fruit season. Children were running around with starved lips, blue, and the French wouldn't pass a single piece of fruit for the children. And so we were led away.

They are taking away our business; they eat away from us everything; and we just stand there and look on. Now we are the masters. We shall get rid of them."

Cattle, horses -- the cars were locked, without windows, without air, just like beasts are being transported. Cattle. Alors! We all got in. It was very high to climb.

She was a very weak child and she was eight years old. She was very weak. We traveled in the train. We had to travel an hour and a half, two hours, or more. Normally it would have taken only an hour, but the train dragged on for about two hours. The child felt nauseated. She wanted, excuse me, to throw up.</span>

Very high, higher than a man and a big black gate opens for us. We are led through the gate. We pass one gate, another gate, three gates we have to pass and we see from a distance a big black barracks knocked together from plain thin boards. Between one board and the other one could stick through his head and look outside. It just looked like a "suka". [Footnote: A tent built by Jews in connection with the autumn holidays.] A suka is even better, more stable. Inside of this big barracks were a few bundles of straw and the guards told us that now we have to stay here. "There is some straw. Each one of you may take a bit of straw and lie down on the floor."

They spread out a bit of straw. Everyone had some rags, a blanket, a little towel. I saw even some foolish people who had dragged with them feather-beds. They exhausted their guts dragging them. They were all exhausted. What for? Just to salvage a few more things from home. Let it be a pillow; let it be a feather bed; let it be some of the better things. It's all over. We shan't see our homes anymore. We shall not see our things anymore. They exhausted their guts. My child was made to drag a quota of bundles, the sixteen-year-old one. And the poor dear spread out on the straw and I asked she should be given something to soothe her. "Nurse, give here something." And she gave her some kind of a pill to put her to sleep. Well. She got pains dragging the bundles. I couldn't carry anything. I was very weak. I was taken from bed, sick. I had an attack of gall bladder. But she dragged. She was the older one. Sixteen years old. She looked like a twenty-year-old one. Everybody calls her the beautiful Marie [she begins to weep] She was so beautiful. [Here a few words become incomprehensible due to her sobbing. All one hears are the words "my child." Women would approach me, "Madam, who is this young girl, the beautiful one, the blond one?" [Here she sobs violently.] My child. [Wails again cover her words. Only words audible, "my daughter." We arrived in <a class="placename" href="#vothC88" type="camp">Pithiviers</a>. A day passed. And she became a bit stronger, but she still was weak and she lost all her courage. So she says, "Mother, I feel that from here I shall not get out anymore." So I say, "Mara, you are young. You had courage; so go on having courage. God will not abandon us. Let us see what will happen next." So she says, "you know I have a girl friend, an Austrian, Mariann." Mariann Brger, was her name. A neighbor of ours. And she had a canteen, a canteen where they were selling all kinds of things to prisoners. Some lemonade, a comb, a handkerchief, some other little things. Notion, and such other things, so she engaged her to be a salesgirl. So she said, "I have accepted the job, I will be with Mariann," she said, "I want to do it." So she together with the other used to carry around the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> such big cases of dirty bottles, selling one to each, one to each, one to each, one to each, one to each. Just as much as she could. She met with an accident. I was out in the yard with the two children. She was lying on the straw. She was very tired and since there were little children, and a little boy had in his hands a kind of club, a little stick, so he passed by and saw her lying so he struck her over her little head. So it was. I hear people running. People yell, "Mara is injured, Mara F. has been injured." I go inside. She lies in a puddle of blood. He has struck her with the stick over the head. Possibly she got a fracture of the skull. Others told me that one of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gendarme">gendarmes</a> did it. An anti-Semite. While she was sleeping he passed by with a club and hit her over the head.</span>

She got acquainted there with a doctor. The doctor, also a Jew, was a prisoner. So he took her as a nurse, as a nurse for the sick. Alas, he was taken away with the same transport as they.</span>

The 16th of July we were arrested and this happened the 29th or 30th. I don't know exactly. They were led out on the square for deportation, to death. Yes. They were led out at six o'clock, so I thought they will stand there and hour, and they will embark them into the trains. Doomed. They will be deported. So they were kept there from six in the morning until seven in the evening. It was 40 degrees of heat [Footnote: centigrade]. Bees burned to death in the air. Hot!

The foolish people had dragged their feather beds with pillows, so they cut them open. They thought if they take the feather beds and the pillows, they will have it soft to sleep, but they were cut up, and the field looked, in July, as if it were winter.

I had some eau de cologne. I gave her some drops to take on the train, so she made signs to me from a distance. We were not permitted to go near them. All day already they would not permit the people who remained in the barracks to come near to these who were assigned for deportation. "Mother," she yelled, "they take everything away." I heard it.

I said "Yes." My child was in bed sleeping. It was eight o'clock in the morning. What has happened? A French woman has reported on her that she went to Etoile [Footnote: The most famous park in the city of <a class="placename" href="#vothL13">Paris</a>] and she doesn't carry the yellow star and she goes to the movies. Don't you know it was regulated when to go to the store. Children couldn't go out to play. You could buy things only between one and two, and in the afternoon from three to four. Summertime we had to lock ourselves in at eight o'clock. We could not go out in the street. One couldn't go out to a railroad station. The Jew could not go out in the large parks. In the first class car of the metro [Footnote: The subway in <a class="placename" href="#vothL13">Paris</a> has cars of first and second class.] the Jew had no right to travel. On the railroad a Jew could not travel. So the man says, "Yes, you know you have been reported, that you are not carrying your star and you go to the movies and you are a Jewess, and that is prohibited to you."</span>

That was three weeks before. That was in June and we were later taken in July. He says, "You have time, don't hurry. Drink your coffee. Don't hurry. It isn't so bad. A Frenchwoman has reported that you don't wear your star, that you go to the movies. Well, you will explain and they will let you go." Well, I made coffee for my child. It was her last coffee with me. And the man was joking and laughing. To him it was a kind of an every day event, just as lighting a cigarette. To take a Jewish child out of bed, eight o'clock in the morning. To take her to the German commandant, like into hell, where the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> people were sitting with their rubber truncheans beating and killing. She got dressed and left. When she arrived she found there some other people who had been arrested, Jewish people who had also been reported by the French. From there they were soon sent away to a prison. I was running around a day, two, three, four, nobody would tell me where my child was. I went to the prefecture. I ran here, I ran there. Nobody wants to tell me where she is. Through hard efforts I find out where she is. I arrived there with a package of food, to pass it on to her because for the three days that the child was away she had nothing to eat, no money, no food, nothing. And they don't let me even hear her, just like she would be the greatest criminal, the worst murderer. What has she done? She didn't wear the Jewish star. If one would carry on the street a star, and one point would not be so straight, they would tear it off and deport the person to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. At last I found my child. I passed on to her the package of food, but they do not permit me to see her. Just like a murderer. On the third, fourth day I brought her a change of clothes. She left the house well dressed with a hat on her head, dressed very elegantly. They passed on to me her things. I gave her other things, and so four days had passed. Then I received a letter I should come and look for her in such and such a place. Finally I managed to arrange to meet her. And so I was admitted. Here I entered. So I say, "What is happening, Sulamith?" [Her Hebrew name is Sulamith.] What has happened to my child? What is the offense?" "Yes," she says, "Mother, a Frenchwoman has tattled on me that I have not been wearing the Jewish Star and that I was going to the movies, and that is why I am in prison." She was sent away to the... prison that had been a big armory. I did not find my daughter alone. I found about five hundred or six hundred people!</span>

There were <a class="term" href="#vothG_gendarme">gendarmes</a> and police who watched, of course, trying to catch a word of the conversation. There were spies among them; also <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> agents. There was among them a German woman from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> (which they found out later) but they did not know then that she was from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a>. They thought she was also a prisoner, and she was assigned to spy after the young girls who were possible mixed up in politics or similar affairs, or who were talking against Germany or such things. When I came I found that my child was also so foolish. "Mother, you see, this woman is a very fine, a very decent woman. She too is a prisoner like myself." So I say to her, "My child, my dear child. You are so naive. Don't you recognize that she is from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a>? She being a German? She is here to spy after you. In case you say a word that is not just so and they will put you in the lock-up." And I made it clear to her that one should not talk about improper things. "And with that woman you should not talk at all. Neither should your good friends talk to her".... So she tells me that the woman is a prisoner, and her husband is a prisoner, and he was among the men and she among the women. And such foolish children could not understand that these two people were employees of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a>. Do you understand? In all the child was there two weeks. In these two weeks we saw each other twice. I took to her some things. I took to her a package of food. She, alas, knew that they will be sent to Germany. There were some French <a class="term" href="#vothG_gendarme">gendarmes</a> who had a bit of heart, so they told them, you should know that you will be sent from here to work in Germany. But there were exceptions, people who remained there for six months, and there were a few others who remained there for a year. But my child was just out of luck, she remained there only for two weeks, and she was deported.</span>

I turn around and there are about another hundred people. Nobody is admitted any more to them. They were taken to the third story, locked up, assigned for deportation. They are being held just like criminals. No families are admitted; they are not permitted to write..... We were running back and forth for a day and two until I broke down with the bundle in my hand. I knew that my child is very much in need of things to wear. I run with the bundle here. I run with the bundle there. I turn to one inspector, I turn to another policeman, again to a police officer. I run from one office to another office. I fall to their feet, I kiss their hands. "My child is bare and naked; let me in with the package. She is being deported I know tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Let me pass to her a pair of shoes. She has no shoes; a dress, something to eat." They have received orders from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> as to those people who have been assigned for deportation, not to pass even a needle. And like myself many hundreds have turned around with their bundles, getting nowhere. And the next day we came and they were not there anymore. We were told that they were sent away to <a class="placename" href="#vothC27" type="camp">Drancy</a>. From <a class="placename" href="#vothC27" type="camp">Drancy</a> they were to be deported to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. And so a day passed and behold I receive a letter, and the letter was from my child. She managed to obtain a scrap of paper and a pencil and when they put them on the train for deportation she managed to write down a few words to her mother. To her mother, she knew that we all were still home. And so she writes: "My dear parents: We are being deported en direction inconnu." Do you know what that means? We are being deported to an address unknown, inconnu. "We are being transported like cattle in locked cars. We have no food, nor drink; we have no things. However, our morale is good, and we are strong. I am in the best of health. Don't cry, Mother, and tell the children not to cry. I am young and I will come through. I am young and I hope we will see each other again. I kiss you. And see that you do not fall into the hands of the Germans. Hide yourselves. Get away from <a class="placename" href="#vothL13">Paris</a>. Hide in a village. Hide so they should not trap you as they have trapped me. And I hope we will see each other and I will come through because I am young." And to this day I have not seen my child. Four dark years have passed, and I don't know where her bones rest.</span>

I had the letter but there were constant raids by the Germans. They used to search around the house for various papers. My husband said, "I am afraid to keep such a letter. We can all be killed for such a letter. Because if they are in the train they are not permitted to write any more." So my husband took the letter and burned it. It was the first and the last message I had from my child, written in German. She wrote German beautifully. And this is the way I lost my two daughters. And I am now here, with my husband, and my husband is sick, 99% sick, and this is the end of life. We have no courage, We have no morals. Lest the world will intervene and we shall be able to return to life again. Otherwise we are doomed.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="#freilichF" start="4976.840" end="x">Yes. People, young people. Like sheer skeletons. They cannot stand on their feet. They have kept them for six, seven weeks in those <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lagers</a> and did not give them more than five or six times to eat. Young people. When they were brought into <a class="placename" href="#vothC27" type="camp">Drancy</a> they told us that they were now in a paradise. When they got a little bit of soup and something was spilled on the floor, they would get down on all fours and lick up that soup from the mud. They were crazy from starvation, plain crazy. Their things were so messed up that one could not recognize whether they are clothes, whether they are rags. They have slept in them six or seven weeks. These were people who were caught on the street in Free France and they were not permitted to take anything from home, but [were dragged] straight from the streets into the trucks. And from the trucks they were taken to prison, and I forgot already what the name of that <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> was. But from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> they were taken to <a class="placename" href="#vothC27" type="camp">Drancy</a>, and from <a class="placename" href="#vothC27" type="camp">Drancy</a> they were deported to Germany. And such people were taken to work when they didn't even have strength to lift their feet, to get into railroad cars. Young beautiful children. Eighteen, twenty years old. All emaciated and crazy from starvation. Insane from starvation. If they noticed a little piece of turnip on the floor it was as if they had found a piece of the best chocolate, [they would pick up ] a leaf of putrid lettuce, and they kissed our hands [pleading ]: "A little piece of bread." Because we were still fresh, we were there only eight days. We had taken something from home. We still had something to eat, and we gave them. We shared with them, but one couldn't give away everything. We did not know yet that we will go free. And although we knew that they will be deported we had to save something for our children. And so we saw two transports go away. Dead people shoved into cars and deported. Why did they have to deport them to Germany? To bury them? They could bury them here. Dead, young exhausted skeletons. And so things went on. They cooked a kettle for them. They gave each one a little ration of beans for their journey, for their trip to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. A little piece of bread, a little piece of cheese was given to them, and they were pushed into railroad cars and they were sent away to Germany. I saw myself with my own eyes how they dragged out of <a class="placename" href="#vothC27" type="camp">Drancy</a> for deportation ninety-year-old women. The police supported them under the arms because they couldn't drag their legs. And they put them up in line for the count. Women with children! I saw little girls, little boys, who went with their mothers into the cars and they were sent away to Germany. And so I saw in those eight days deported from <a class="placename" href="#vothC27" type="camp">Drancy</a> possibly a hundred thousand people. At the time of the third transport there came an order that all families of those men who worked for the Germans should be freed. Now the French wanted to appear nice since the people who would leave now would start telling. So they told us [she speaks in a mocking tone ], "You are going free. What a pity of these people who remain. Give them your food. You are now going home. They are being sent away. They are being deported. One cannot tell how long they will be en route." So we should given them the food that we had. They tried to appear decent so that when we should go out we would say, "The French are nice people. They have told us to give away our food."

            <span class="utterance" who="#freilichF" start="5317.233" end="x">No. Almost nobody has returned. In our neighborhood there were two hundred families. There have returned as follows: a man, a woman -- Monsieur so and so [this is not clear], Madame so and so -- and nobody else has returned. A single man and a single women from our house. Two prisoners [of war ] have returned who were taken prisoners and were held in Germany. Of all those who were taken prisoners in Germany only four thousand have returned. And that is how things happened. We were taken to be released through a small gate and from the other side people were led into the railroad cars for deportation. That is how things came to pass Monsieur Professor. Here were people standing for deportation and we were led out, all those who had been arrested and had certificates that they were working for the Germans, which were about sixty or seventy families. They let us all go. This was not to the liking of the French. They were wondering, "What for do we need Jews? If they have already been arrested, to let them out again, what's that?" We told then that the Germans have done that for us. We were interested to hear what they would have to say because our men were not afraid of them. "Our men are working for the Germans and that is why we were released". They were such anti-Semites, and they could not savor it. And so I got out with my two children, Monsieur Professor. I spent a few months at home, and again they came pounding at the door. The Germans had bad luck. They didn't need anymore fur jackets, they didn't need anybody anymore to work for them, but what they did need was that all people who did work for them should go to <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. All of them. And so the third time (the good angel wanted it that way), we didn't sleep at home. We slept in another house.</span>
