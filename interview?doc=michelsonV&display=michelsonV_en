The UNRRA University grew out of this initiative, officially opening in February 1946.

Michelson was the president of the UNRRA University Students' Union. He helped to define the university as an international institution. He discusses his goals for the university later in the interview. On the history of the university, see Bernhard Zittel, 'Die UNRRA-UniversitÃ¤t in MÃ¼nchen, 1945-1947,' in Archivalische Zeitschrift 75 (1979); Anna Holian, 'Displacement and the Postwar Reconstruction of Education: Displaced Persons at the UNRRA University of Munich, 1945-1948,' in Contemporary European History 17:2 (May 2008); and Nina Bschorr, '"Wir wollten alle so gerne lernen..."

The Socialist Revolutionary Party (SRP) was one of the leading socialist parties in Russia in the period leading up to the Bolshevik Revolution. Founded in 1901, it grew out of the Russian populist movement and focused on the plight of both peasants and industrial workers under capitalism. In contrast to the Social Democratic Workers' Party (Mensheviks and Bolsheviks), which called for the nationalization of the land, the SRP advocated the socialization of the land: its transformation into public property that would be worked individually by peasant tenants. Socialist Revolutionaries, most notably Alexander Kerensky, held important posts in the Provisional Government formed after the Russian Revolution of February 1917. The SRP won the most seats of any party in the election for the Constituent Assembly in November 1917. However, the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917 caused a split in the party, with a new left wing siding with the Bolsheviks in calling for a communist revolution. After the Bolsheviks definitively seized power, many members of the mainstream SRP went into exile.</span><sup><a href="#note_7">7</a></sup></note> I was brought up on these same viewpoints, and I always considered myself . . . ehh . . . not a person . . . anyway not . . . ehh . . . of Fascist, nor even capable of capitalistic persuasion.

While Michelson's father met his fate in the Soviet Union, purges did take place in Soviet-occupied Estonia. During the first year of occupation, Soviet forces deported or killed some 60,000 persons, under the guise of eliminating "anti-Soviet elements." Although most of the victims were ethnic Estonians, Russian Ã©migrÃ© intellectuals and community leaders were also targeted.</span><sup><a href="#note_10">10</a></sup></note></span>

Maybe scientifically this would not be immediately convertible into useful material, but we just have to do it.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="#michelsonV" start="2062.975" end="x">I myself [pause] found out that a university is being organized in connection with <a class="term" href="#vothG_unrra">UNRRA</a> [pause], and I went to that university not withstanding [in spite of] my knowledge of the German language and not withstanding my knowledge that here is a definite norm for the admission of foreigners into the Germans educational institutions. <note n="22"><span class="note">In the U.S. and British zones, 10% of all university places were reserved for displaced persons.</span><sup><a href="#note_22">22</a></sup></note> I considered that to go to people who have started this war, and who according to their psychology, as previously, hate foreigners, that would mean to go into an environment known to be hostile. On the other hand, during this war, especially here, I had the opportunity to meet not only with Russians who had come from the East, but also with Poles, in part war prisoners who worked with farmers, in part . . . ehh . . . people taken out of there [Poland], and with Ukrainians, and most recently with Balts. And in all of them I noticed one common [character] streak, a streak of desire, after the war [pause], in some way to build, life on a new foundation, especially among the young people. On the basis of understanding each other, and friendship with each other . And it appeared to me that if this university, which is just now being created, would gain strength, if this university [pause] will come to be an entity which could really live and exist, then it could bring about a real collaboration of work with one with another, and especially for us, the people from the East who, as I observed for the last three years, could never come to terms to be friends with each other. They wanted it, but always continued thinking, 'No, I am a Ukrainian.' 'I am a Pole. We can't be together,' or 'I am a Ukrainian, and you are a Muscovite, a Russian. You . . . ehh . . . are oppressing our nation,' et cetera. And it appeared to me that in this university we, the youth, who after [pause] sufficient preparation will become the leaders in their own countries, in their own lands . . . if we should be friends among ourselves we would be able to create a rapprochement between our countries to an extent necessary in order that there will be neither wars nor these horrible totalitarian regimes which humiliate man and [oppress] his abilities to think and to create for the good of other [his fellow] men. And with this idea I came to the university. The first thing that I noticed at the university [pause] was that there was no such idea, that people have come here after the long years, during which they were torn away from learning, in order to study. That was good. But [pause] that was not all. What was missing here was unity, and for that reason the scholastic, academic spirit was also missing. [Pause] And already during the first month [pause] I, we, meaning, at the faculty started to talk thus: That in order to live actually in friendship, and in order to create academic conditions not akin to an average <a class="term" href="#vothG_dp">DP</a> camp, which very many have experienced and which very many have left for the same reasons that I have left, we have to hold together and demand toward ourselves a different attitude, different than accorded to the average masses [of <a class="term" href="#vothG_dp">DP's</a>], an attitude toward us as students, as studying youth.</span>

I think that would interest you. We had here a strike, a very real hunger . . . hunger revolt, I would say. Ehh . . . That may appear strange. However, there were reasons for it. When the students once arrived in the morning at their university, they were not permitted to enter the university by the so-called <a class="term" href="#vothG_dp">DP</a> police, that is, <a class="term" href="#vothG_dp">DP's</a> who were organized to maintain order.</span>

But what was most strange was that they permitted themselves first to push and chase students from corner to corner, and when our professors arrived, after detaining the dean of the university, they submitted him to a meticulous . . . ehh . . . search, compelled him to present all kinds of documents, and treated him most impertinently. This aroused the students most of all. Afterwards quite a few professors of advanced age, in order to get into the university, had to jump over benches, among them a lady . . . ehh . . . , a microbiologist, most respected among us as a professor, was obliged to do the same and this was the reason that the students started a frightful noise and literally were beside themselves [Pause]. For me as the president of the student organization of our university it was very hard to quiet down the aroused students. After assembling them with great difficulty in the yard of the university, I asked the people to calm down, not to cause great debauchery, and if they want at all to do something . . . I agreed to the demand of the majority of the students to decide not to take any nourishment, not to eat, until we would be promised that the police will be removed and police method will not be used in our university. The strike lasted, all together, one day, only two times [meaning twice they staged a hunger strike] but it proved that during the six months which we had spent in the university all the students, without distinction of nationality or creed, had united into such a family that all went out on such a risky venture as a strike. There was complete solidarity. This is just an example, an example of that which we consider a wrong attitude towards students, and which arouses our indignation. That is precisely why we are talking about the academic spirit and relationships.</span>

And we want the creation of an international university. We know that what we have here now in <a class="placename" href="#vothL29">Munich</a> is not an international university. Or better, it is international, but not yet a university, because we are short of very many things. Even we ourselves, in our own views about the world, [and] in our . . . ehh . . . opportunities, needed to call ourselves a real international university. But we think that we could serve as a kernel for such a cooperation, and for such a university in which would be brought up the intelligentsia of the future. That is about all.</span>

            In August 1945, DP students and professors began organizing university courses at the Deutsches Museum DP camp in Munich. The UNRRA University grew out of this initiative, officially opening in February 1946. It was named after the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the international relief agency created by the Allies to assist victims of the war. Michelson was the president of the UNRRA University Students' Union. He helped to define the university as an international institution. He discusses his goals for the university later in the interview. On the history of the university, see Bernhard Zittel, 'Die UNRRA-UniversitÃ¤t in MÃ¼nchen, 1945-1947,' in Archivalische Zeitschrift 75 (1979); Anna Holian, 'Displacement and the Postwar Reconstruction of Education: Displaced Persons at the UNRRA University of Munich, 1945-1948,' in Contemporary European History 17:2 (May 2008); and Nina Bschorr, '"Wir wollten alle so gerne lernen..."

            Michelson and his family were part of the substantial Russian Ã©migrÃ© community that developed in Estonia after the Bolshevik Revolution. In 1922, there were approximately 14,000-16,000 unassimilated (i.e., non-citizen) Russian refugees in Estonia. On the history of the Russian emigration, see Marc Raeff, Russia Abroad: A Cultural History of the Russian Emigration, 1919-1939 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990).

            Under the terms of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of August 1939, Estonia was assigned to the Soviet sphere of influence. In September 1939, seeking to make good on its claim to Estonia, the Soviet Union demanded that the Estonian government sign a mutual assistance treaty and allow the Soviets to establish military bases on Estonian soil. The Estonian government felt compelled to accede to this demand. In June 1940, claiming that the Estonian government had not fully complied with the treaty, the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Estonia.

            Freedom of Russia (Svoboda Rossii) was a socialist literary and political newspaper published in  from 1919 to 1920. Although Michelson implies that his father's association with the newspaper lasted up to the period of Soviet occupation, in fact he is describing his father's work during the very beginning of the emigration period.

            While the political spectrum among Russian Ã©migrÃ©s was very broad, most leading Ã©migrÃ© institutions were of a monarchist or rightist orientation. Michelson here stresses that the politics of his father's newspaper were outside the mainstream.

            SR: Socialist Revolutionary. The Socialist Revolutionary Party (SRP) was one of the leading socialist parties in Russia in the period leading up to the Bolshevik Revolution. Founded in 1901, it grew out of the Russian populist movement and focused on the plight of both peasants and industrial workers under capitalism. In contrast to the Social Democratic Workers' Party (Mensheviks and Bolsheviks), which called for the nationalization of the land, the SRP advocated the socialization of the land: its transformation into public property that would be worked individually by peasant tenants. Socialist Revolutionaries, most notably Alexander Kerensky, held important posts in the Provisional Government formed after the Russian Revolution of February 1917. The SRP won the most seats of any party in the election for the Constituent Assembly in November 1917. However, the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917 caused a split in the party, with a new left wing siding with the Bolsheviks in calling for a communist revolution. After the Bolsheviks definitively seized power, many members of the mainstream SRP went into exile.

            The NKVD (Narodnyy Komissariat Vnutrennikh Del or People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs) was the secret police organ of the Soviet Union. Created in 1922, it took over the functions exercised earlier by the Cheka, the state security organization formed by the Bolsheviks shortly after the October Revolution.

            Created in 1922, the GPU (Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie or State Political Directorate) was the state security organization of the Soviet Union and was intermittently part of the NKVD. In 1934, it was succeeded by the Main Directorate of State Security (Glavnoe Upravlenie Gosudarstvennoi Bezopasnosti or GUGB). This is presumably the organization to which Michelson refers.

            Michelson's story about his father, while not strictly speaking true, is likely grounded in fact. According to one obituary for Michelson, his father was the victim of a Stalinist purge (St. Paul Pioneer Press, 5 August 2006). While Michelson's father met his fate in the Soviet Union, purges did take place in Soviet-occupied Estonia. During the first year of occupation, Soviet forces deported or killed some 60,000 persons, under the guise of eliminating "anti-Soviet elements." Although most of the victims were ethnic Estonians, Russian Ã©migrÃ© intellectuals and community leaders were also targeted.

            The Nazi occupation of Estonia began in July 1941, with German troops reaching Tallinn at the end of August. Michelson's vacillation here may have to do with the fact that he was not in Estonia when the events occurred.

            Hitler spent most of his youth in and around Linz. In comparing Michelson to Hitler, Boder seems to be giving voice to his misgivings about Michelson's character, as evidenced by the latter's activities in Nazi-occupied Vienna.

            What Michelson of course neglects to state is that as a Red Army soldier who surrendered to the Germans and served in the German army, he had his own reasons for wanting to avoid an encounter with Soviet forces.

            In general, displaced persons had few opportunities for paid work, with the U.S. Army serving as the main employer in the U.S. zone. DPs who lived 'on the German economy,' as the phrase went, tended to lose their DP benefits.

            In August 1945, DP students and professors began organizing university courses at the Deutsches Museum DP camp in Munich. The UNRRA University grew out of this initiative, officially opening in February 1946. It was named after the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the international relief agency created by the Allies to assist victims of the war. Michelson was the president of the UNRRA University Students' Union. He helped to define the university as an international institution. He discusses his goals for the university later in the interview. On the history of the university, see Bernhard Zittel, 'Die UNRRA-UniversitÃ¤t in MÃ¼nchen, 1945-1947,' in Archivalische Zeitschrift 75 (1979); Anna Holian, 'Displacement and the Postwar Reconstruction of Education: Displaced Persons at the UNRRA University of Munich, 1945-1948,' in Contemporary European History 17:2 (May 2008); and Nina Bschorr, '"Wir wollten alle so gerne lernen..."

            Michelson and his family were part of the substantial Russian Ã©migrÃ© community that developed in Estonia after the Bolshevik Revolution. In 1922, there were approximately 14,000-16,000 unassimilated (i.e., non-citizen) Russian refugees in Estonia. On the history of the Russian emigration, see Marc Raeff, Russia Abroad: A Cultural History of the Russian Emigration, 1919-1939 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990).

            Under the terms of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of August 1939, Estonia was assigned to the Soviet sphere of influence. In September 1939, seeking to make good on its claim to Estonia, the Soviet Union demanded that the Estonian government sign a mutual assistance treaty and allow the Soviets to establish military bases on Estonian soil. The Estonian government felt compelled to accede to this demand. In June 1940, claiming that the Estonian government had not fully complied with the treaty, the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Estonia.

            Freedom of Russia (Svoboda Rossii) was a socialist literary and political newspaper published in  from 1919 to 1920. Although Michelson implies that his father's association with the newspaper lasted up to the period of Soviet occupation, in fact he is describing his father's work during the very beginning of the emigration period.

            While the political spectrum among Russian Ã©migrÃ©s was very broad, most leading Ã©migrÃ© institutions were of a monarchist or rightist orientation. Michelson here stresses that the politics of his father's newspaper were outside the mainstream.

            SR: Socialist Revolutionary. The Socialist Revolutionary Party (SRP) was one of the leading socialist parties in Russia in the period leading up to the Bolshevik Revolution. Founded in 1901, it grew out of the Russian populist movement and focused on the plight of both peasants and industrial workers under capitalism. In contrast to the Social Democratic Workers' Party (Mensheviks and Bolsheviks), which called for the nationalization of the land, the SRP advocated the socialization of the land: its transformation into public property that would be worked individually by peasant tenants. Socialist Revolutionaries, most notably Alexander Kerensky, held important posts in the Provisional Government formed after the Russian Revolution of February 1917. The SRP won the most seats of any party in the election for the Constituent Assembly in November 1917. However, the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917 caused a split in the party, with a new left wing siding with the Bolsheviks in calling for a communist revolution. After the Bolsheviks definitively seized power, many members of the mainstream SRP went into exile.

            The NKVD (Narodnyy Komissariat Vnutrennikh Del or People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs) was the secret police organ of the Soviet Union. Created in 1922, it took over the functions exercised earlier by the Cheka, the state security organization formed by the Bolsheviks shortly after the October Revolution.

            Created in 1922, the GPU (Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie or State Political Directorate) was the state security organization of the Soviet Union and was intermittently part of the NKVD. In 1934, it was succeeded by the Main Directorate of State Security (Glavnoe Upravlenie Gosudarstvennoi Bezopasnosti or GUGB). This is presumably the organization to which Michelson refers.

            Michelson's story about his father, while not strictly speaking true, is likely grounded in fact. According to one obituary for Michelson, his father was the victim of a Stalinist purge (St. Paul Pioneer Press, 5 August 2006). While Michelson's father met his fate in the Soviet Union, purges did take place in Soviet-occupied Estonia. During the first year of occupation, Soviet forces deported or killed some 60,000 persons, under the guise of eliminating "anti-Soviet elements." Although most of the victims were ethnic Estonians, Russian Ã©migrÃ© intellectuals and community leaders were also targeted.

            The Nazi occupation of Estonia began in July 1941, with German troops reaching Tallinn at the end of August. Michelson's vacillation here may have to do with the fact that he was not in Estonia when the events occurred.

            Hitler spent most of his youth in and around Linz. In comparing Michelson to Hitler, Boder seems to be giving voice to his misgivings about Michelson's character, as evidenced by the latter's activities in Nazi-occupied Vienna.

            What Michelson of course neglects to state is that as a Red Army soldier who surrendered to the Germans and served in the German army, he had his own reasons for wanting to avoid an encounter with Soviet forces.

            In general, displaced persons had few opportunities for paid work, with the U.S. Army serving as the main employer in the U.S. zone. DPs who lived 'on the German economy,' as the phrase went, tended to lose their DP benefits.
