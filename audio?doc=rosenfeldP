There were cases where the children were taken and they were hidden in ovens, plastered over. And there were such cases about which I know. A friend of mine took a child and gave it narcotics, and he put it in, one might say, in a far corner of the courtyard, because he figured that the police would go through the house in two hours, and he put it in such a hole and on top he strewed a little sand, just so it should not be known. And thus he saved his child. The largest majority could not find counsel to help themselves. There were cases that mothers went with the children. They were taken along.</p>
