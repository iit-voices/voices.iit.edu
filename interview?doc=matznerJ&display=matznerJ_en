My father, my mother, and I. In the meantime my two sisters and their two children returned from Poland, also illegally. So I arranged for them too an illegal departure to Belgium. An outsider may not be able to comprehend what kind of difficulties such an undertaking presents, to leave the "German soil", as the Nazis called it, especially in secret. First of all, there was the enormous cost of it. Second, we could not take with us anything, because one actually had to crawl across the border. One had to creep on all fours across the border. But at least one would save his life. We arrived then about the ninth of July, 1939, in <a class="placename" href="#vothL146">Antwerp</a>. We were very well received by the Jewish Relief Committee then functioning in Belgium. We obtained an apartment, and we remained in peace in <a class="placename" href="#vothL146">Antwerp</a> until Easter, 1940.</span>

I was forced to spend eleven months there along with nine thousand Jewish refugees, among others with the International Brigade which fought in the Spanish Civil War, and all in all I should say there were possibly nineteen thousand prisoners, who had to live day and night, weeks and months, under most heavy guard, behind five rows of barbed wire. My brother, who lived in France, and had been in France since 1931, and who occupied a very high post as a rabbi, as slaughterer, as dajin, and as teacher in the city of <a class="placename" href="#vothL375">Strassburg</a>, was at that time evacuated to the south of France. My brother was able to vouch for me; I gained permission to settle in a small village, where my brother lived, where various other Jews of <a class="placename" href="#vothL375">Strassburg</a> were evacuated, and thus through the efforts of my brother I was released from this horrible <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>.

Some people tried to put underneath some little piece of baggage that they had salvaged, so that they could sit on it, but immediately these pieces of baggage were pushed out from underneath them, they were thrown to the ground and had to get back in the bended knee posture. (It would be erroneous to attribute the procedure of keeping multitudes of prisoners in bended knee position only to Nazi perfectionism in torture. There is evidence that the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> guards were themselves greatly frightened while handling such crowds of hostile humanity. Keeping the prisoners in an awkward position near the ground was of course an assurance of their helplessness, and consequent safety for the guards. The added wanton cruelty was an effective stop gap against being overcome all at once by pity and compassion for the victims.) And so we were sitting there for about forty minutes. In forty minutes there arrived an automobile, and an <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> man alighted, all decorated with plenty of gold around his neck and on his chest, and we inferred from that that he must have been a higher sort of animal.

And prisoners who would escape at night, if such a thing were possible at all, or from the various construction jobs, would have been followed by the dogs with their supervisors until they were found.

You will all land back in <a class="placename" href="#vothL139">Jerusalem</a>, but not back there in the <a class="placename" href="#vothL139">Jerusalem</a> that you hope to see.

He himself was in despair over the situation of the people for whom he had taken the responsibility. And so the winter came. Every day we had dead. People frozen, killed, or dead from starvation. We worked then in the . . . plant. There was a chief engineer, Reichman, who put on the appearance of being a decent person. He was the general work manager, and was always ready to help and so on and so on. But in the meantime this man tortured the prisoners to death by means of work assignments. At night and in fog, day and night, we had to work outdoors. We had nothing to wear. Our overcoats were taken away from us and were deposited in the storeroom of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, and we were not permitted to wear them.</span>

Then there was a foreman from . . . His name was Bielka. This man daily killed people with his own hand. He killed them with shovels. Not those long shovels, but the short spades. He beat people with them daily, who most frequently died afterwards from such injuries. This Bielka also got after me, and only through a fortunate accident I was transferred to another work division and got out from under Bielka's eyes.

Since I have shown myself very willing and have presented myself for any kind of work, I was never beaten inside the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. But of course, you must remember that we had a Jewish <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> <a class="term" href="#vothG_trusty">trusty</a> and as Jews we still had a certain amount of solidarity. Inside the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> we were rarely beaten. Only in cases where disciplinary punishment was administered for disobedience, which may have happened to all of us. It was only at work that we were beaten regularly and that was by the SA and by the foreman. The foremen were mostly Polish and non-Jews. I remember well how we got an order to dig holes for telegraph poles. To this job they assigned a Dutch Jew by the name of Hammerschlag, and three other Jews from Poland, and myself. And so there were five of us. Now, to dig in December or January in clay soil that was frozen harder than granite, in the beastly cold of thirty to forty degrees [centigrade] frozen harder than granite—and here we had to dig a hole. And we had to do it, there was not way out. And I must say we worked half naked to get it done. The sweat poured from us in torrents, and we had to do it, and we had to do the job. So we got it done, but at what sacrifice! Of the five people who worked at that hole, two Polish Jews froze to death, and also this Hammerschlag, that Dutch Jew. I myself had signs of frozen legs, and I myself was one of those who carried the dead from the place of work into the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. I shall never forget the impression that is made by the face of a man frozen to death. I got the impression that these people were laughing. One notices on the faces a kind of transition, as if at the beginning of the agony the people distort their faces, and for the onlooker it creates the impression that he is laughing. This dead man—and that already is the dead from freezing - and this expression remains on the face as if they were laughing; and those dead had to be buried immediately, because in this <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> we had no crematory, and so there was a special detail. Their duty was to dig graves in the near forest. And it wasn't worth the trouble for the SA to assign a detail for each dead man; so the dead were kept in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> until they has accumulated ten, twelve or fifteen dead. And that never took long; it always happened within five or six days. And then the ten of fifteen dead would be carried out, naked as they were, dirty, and filthy, in a terrible state. They were simply thrown into the pit, etc., etc. At the beginning we were still permitted to say Kadesh.[This is a prayer for the dead]. And we would throw in there the dead. Later appeared, an old Schlomask. Schlomasks is what we called the foremen and guards. And so this old Scholomask prohibited it. "What are you mumbling there? Nonsense. Stop that nonsense. Do your work and go." We were in this <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> until the end of summer 1942, and during the summer of 1942 this <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> was evacuated.

Then we had to struggle to get our food, because the people there were frozen stiff and starved, and the people had to stand in line until they got a bit of soup. Water soup with turnips. And when they had gulped down their soup, they had to get back into the halls to bed. There they handed out that little piece of bread. For eight, nine or twelve people a two-pound loaf.

            <span class="utterance" who="#matznerJ" start="2606.736" end="x">I was found suitable to be assigned as clerk. The <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> foreman told me afterwards, "That is a great opportunity for you. This may be your lucky moment." The same night I was dressed up. That is, I was given clean clothes. Up to then we were wearing sheer rags, and early in the morning at about four o'clock I had to depart, accompanied by the same Obershaar-<a class="term" href="#vothG_fuehrer">fuehrer</a> Weigel. We traveled then as far as the station <a class="placename" href="#vothL106">Striegau</a> in upper Silesia, and from there we marched on foot. On the way that Obershaar-<a class="term" href="#vothG_fuehrer">fuehrer</a> told me in his <a class="placename" href="#vothL228">Sudeten</a>land German dialect, "Don't you dare to disgrave me. Stand at attention, don't ask any questions, and keep your mouth shut." All at once I noticed a sign "<a class="placename" href="#vothC39" type="camp">Gross-Rosen</a>", and a chill went through my body.[He uses the expression: "I got pale inside of me"] I was checked in, and here are the subsequent events.I was put in prisoner's uniform, the blue-white uniform. I was given the number 20-201. Meanwhile there were delivered from other <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lagers</a> twenty-four Jews and a few days later we were assigned to <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> <a class="placename" href="#vothC147" type="camp">Wüstegiersdorf</a>, also in Upper Silesia. In <a class="placename" href="#vothC147" type="camp">Wüstegiersdorf</a> we were taken over by Obersturm-<a class="term" href="#vothG_fuehrer">fuehrer</a> Lichtemeier. This man made a speech, telling us that we were now to erect the camps, to build them, and that any instance of misbehavior would be punished by death without delay. We were ordered to select from our midst a <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> deputy, who was to be responsible for the whole <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, and we were sent to <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> <a class="placename" href="#vothC146" type="camp">Wolfsberg</a>. <a class="placename" href="#vothC146" type="camp">Wolfsberg</a> was really an empty stretch of hills and valleys—bare grounds and we were to build a <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. We were given the material, and within the next day or two arrived the first eight thousand Greek and Hungarian Jews. And they arrived from <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. These Jews were immediately checked in. They all had tattoes and were assigned to build the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> with the material at our disposal, and shortly the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> was ready. It did not consist of "<a class="term" href="#vothG_block">blocks</a>" but of some type of round eskimo tents. We called them Finnish tents.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="#matznerJ" start="2794.168" end="x">Within a short time we had a population of about twenty-one thousand persons, all Jews. Rabbis, shochets ( Slaugters of cattle and fowl according to hebrew ritual. ), scholars, chazidim, ( An ultra orthodox Jewish religious sect. ) artisans, judges, lawyers, workingmen—Poles, Hungarians, Rumanians, Germans, French, Greek—a wholly international conglomeration of humanity. But in spite of that, we the leaders had decided to hold together, and to help and save everyone. We established a hospital under the direction of the Hungarian physicians Dr. Friek and Dr. Deutsch, and we put there all the rabbis, all scholars, all chasids, even if they were not sick, simply to protect these people who had never worked/physically/ from the heavy labor in the tunnel. You see, a tunnel of twenty-five to thirty kilometers was being constructed, and we were the ones to construct it. Every day we had deaths. Construction accidents, cave-ins, the excavating machines killed people daily; the foremen were clubbing people; they knew it was a question of life or death. And only because we had a good organization were we able to see to it that inside of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> itself nothing should happen contrary to our intentions. There we remained until January, 1945. In January 1945, the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> was abandoned. We knew already why. Our exploratory senses and our eyes were directed toward the outside world. We knew the Russians were on the march. Ever night we saw how <a class="placename" href="#vothL313">Breslau</a> was bombed. We saw the allied fortresses flying over our <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lagers</a>, who knew for certain that the people there below, in the blue and white uniforms, were their own and that no bombs should be dropped on them.</span>

We were transported to <a class="placename" href="#vothL396">Schimberg</a>. These were all just small villages, stations that received us until we came to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> <a class="placename" href="#vothC8" type="camp">Bergen-Belsen</a>. En route we had, not dozens, but hundreds of deaths. People who were old and sick and weak and unable to stand the march would fall on the road. We had to drag them with us and bury them at night. We had orders from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ss">SS</a> to break out the gold teeth before burial. So we marched on and on. Piles of corpses and mountains of corpses rose, which were just buried anywhere or scarcely covered with sand. And then one night we arrived at <a class="placename" href="#vothC8" type="camp">Bergen-Belsen</a>. <a class="placename" href="#vothC8" type="camp">Bergen-Belsen</a>—at first we did not see this <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> in its true light. But the next day we understood; we saw the treatment accorded us. Undress, give up everything, lie down, stand up, <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appells</a> lasting for hours. By <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appells</a> lasting for hours is to understand <a class="term" href="#vothG_appell">appells</a> lasting fifteen to twenty hours, in mud, in snow, in ice, in water, Nightly we had people in the barracks who had gone to bed in the evening and were dead by the morning after. In darkness we were unable to see what was going on in these pestilent and over-crowded <a class="term" href="#vothG_block">blocks</a>. One was killing the other. The population of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> must have reached the hundred thousand mark. Gentiles and Jews, Catholics, Protestants, Engligh, parachutists, French volunteers who were fighting on the side of the allies, Jews, <a class="term" href="#vothG_maquis">Maquis</a>—all of them were here, and every one knew it was merely a matter of minutes. In <a class="placename" href="#vothC8" type="camp">Bergen-Belsen</a> I saw for the first time how people were burned on open pyres. Apparently the gas or gas piping stopped to function; so they piled the people in mounds and poured gas over them and burned them on open pyres. ( I apparently was in such a trance that I did not interrupt him to ascertain that those "people" were corpses only. Presumably they were. ) One got accustomed to such a sight as if it was something ordinary. It is terrible to say that. And up to this day I can't conceive how I was able to bear this stench which would not only come through the nose but would stick to one's palates as if it were something palpable; this repugnant, pestilent stench that filled the air.</span>

            <span class="utterance" who="#matznerJ" start="3119.930" end="x">One day it was announced that a labor transport was being formed for some other <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. We wanted to get away from <a class="placename" href="#vothC8" type="camp">Bergen-Belsen</a> at any cost. We reported accordingly, and we had the good fortune to be among the three thousand persons that were chosen. And we marched to the railroad, and after a trip lasting a full day and a full night we arrived at Messantine. Messantine is a small place near <a class="placename" href="#vothL402">Frankfurt-on-the-Oder</a> or <a class="placename" href="#vothL303">Stetin</a>. After all, we never knew where we were. At any rate we were working now in the industries in <a class="placename" href="#vothL401">Pohlitz</a>. This is a plant as big as a city. They manufactured there benzine and fuel. A foreman under whom I worked told me that this plant was producing four and one-half million liters of fuel daily, until there came one night nearly two thousand English and American planes in waves and within an hour or so demolished the whole plant. At any rate, it was our duty to clean the place up. We had to remove the wreckage and mountains of rubble, and the work had to go on. However, we were already under artillery fire of the Russians who were located on the opposite shore of the Oder. Our <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> and plant were on this side of the Oder, and the Russians were already on the opposite side. The locality was under artillery fire, and one day we had as many as twenty-five or twenty-six dead and injured, among them guards who were also killed by bombs and missiles of the Russian artillery. So we cleared also this <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>, and then we came to <a class="placename" href="#vothC5" type="camp">Barth</a>. <a class="placename" href="#vothL169">Barth</a> was a small town near <a class="placename" href="#vothL404">Wismar</a>. And there we were located in the Heinkel aircraft works. The Heinkel aircraft works looked very beautiful. The <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> was very beautiful, but what occurred there defies any descriptions. I noticed there for the first time that I was beginning to weaken. I could not stand it any more. And my friend with whom I had been together all the time, all these years, Fischel Wiener from <a class="placename" href="#vothL98">Sosnovitz</a>, was telling me "Matzner, hold out, brace up, keep up your strength; it cannot last much longer; you must."</span>

One of my best friends, Moishe Rotbart, hanged himself, a pious man, who said, "I can't stand it any more." At work he was gnashing his teeth. He was eager to survive, but he couldn't, and he took his own life. A day later we saw him lying, down there in the cellar, a corpse. And so we had suicides daily and daily more people were killed. One "fine" morning I felt that I had fever. I have been having fever most of the time, but that morning it was especially high, and I went to the hospital to have my temperature taken, and the attendant measured a temperature of 39.6 degrees. With the slip on which he had written that I had a temperature of 39.6 I went to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> foreman and pleaded with him to let me remain in the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> since I had such a high temperature. He gave me a kick in the stomach.</span>

He gave me a kick in the stomach and said, "You Jew-pig, get out of here. For you it is high time that you croak." Because of that kick, I fell, and remained lying on the ground. I felt only that I was trampled in the face and on the back. And so I was lying there, and when I came to (you see, I lost consciousness) I found myself in the cellar. This cellar was an invention of this Befauer. The cellar was about chest-high under water. In the water at the time of my arrival were lying and standing about ninety or ninety-five people.</span>

And these who were standing had arranged the bodies of the dead in such a manner that they could stand or sit on them; otherwise the ones who were still living would also have drowned. I did the same thing. I found myself a place at the wall. I dragged one or two bodies which were under the water and arranged them under the water against the wall, and I sat on them. And so I remained in the water, counting from that morning exactly two days and two nights. During this time my buddy drowned, who stood next to me, Ludwig Pasternak, from Hungary, who constantly pleaded with me. "Matzner," he would say to me, "if I should not be saved, tell my cousin who lives in <a class="placename" href="#vothL261">Toulouse</a> that I have died and that my last thoughts were with my father, my other, and my family. Tell my cousin John Hillman that I could not stand it anymore." This John Hillman was in the same <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a>. And so my friend died. So died my friend Ludwig Pasternak. I think a relative of his was the famous opera singer Louis Pasteur. (He apparently has confused the name.) And then all at once it began to happen. I myself don't really know how. I was almost unconscious throughout these days and nights. I just breathed instinctively; I just lived instinctively. I had nothing to eat or to drink, but I was still alive. And all at once they were yelling: "Out! Out!" And people from upstairs came down, and all at once I found myself in a room. And there was not water, and I was lying on the floor, and afterwards on a table. And again my friend Fishel Wiener was standing before me, and he was just saying to me, "Matzner, you will live, you will live. The Russians are at the gate, the Russians are coming." Then I knew I was lying in a real bed, where everything was white, and then it was night. And there came to me a man. He stroked my head, and I only recognized a uniform of the color worn by the American soldiers. He stroked my head and spoke to me, but I could not understand him. Then he called a nurse. She was all in white. I did not know that he was calling a nurse; I understood that he had called a nurse only when I saw her there. She wore a white cap over her head and spoke Russian, and he said something to her, and returned after some time with two bottles, and he poured the content of these two bottles over me and washed me with it. It was cognac. Today I know that it was whiskey or cognac. Then I didn't know what it was, but it refreshed me miraculously.</span>

His name was Nissin—I just called him Nissim. ( Nissim means in Hebrew "miracles". He used it apparently as a nickname for Mr. Nissin. ) He was just calling, "Adonai, Adonai, Adonai! Matzner that is good for you, that is good." "Ce hace bien, Ce hace bien!" He spoke French, "Ce hace bien pour vous, ce hace bien." And I came to, and I later came under the treatment of a Russian physician—I have forgotten his name. At any rate I went through a violent attack of typhus.</span>

And from <a class="placename" href="#vothL405">Bad Schwartau</a> I came to an <a class="term" href="#vothG_unrra">UNRRA</a> <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">lager</a> in <a class="placename" href="#vothL343">Geldern</a>, which is near <a class="placename" href="#vothL410">Kevelaer</a> at the Dutch border, and from there I returned to my home town <a class="placename" href="#vothL35">Wiesbaden</a>. ( From here a few paragraphs of the interview are missing due to technical failure in the recorder. ) It drove me to <a class="placename" href="#vothL35">Wiesbaden</a> first because I believed that from there I might start the search for my family. Also because it was in the American zone. I returned to <a class="placename" href="#vothL35">Wiesbaden</a>. And I was still very sick, very weak, and I gradually recovered only due to the help of some American friends whose acquaintance I had made, especially a Captain Dave Le-Melman, from <a class="placename" href="#vothL411">Miami</a>, who took a special interest in me.</span>

                Established in the spring of 1943 and initially intended as a transit camp, it soon was integrated into the concentration camp network.  Its population swelled late in the war as inmates from other camps further east were moved into it--from around 15,000 in late 1944 to 41,250 in March 1945.
