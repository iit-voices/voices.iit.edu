The workers—the Polish workers, have demonstrated at meetings that they have proved to the Polish people that these pogroms are not only directed against the Jews, but that the hand that beats and kills the . . . the Polish 'democrats' [democratic people], the hand of intervention which fights against the Polish government, is provoking such pogroms in order to harm [the prestige, to prejudice against] the Polish people in [the eyes of] foreign countries; and in order to evoke unrest at home. And the effect is that during recent times order [calm] was established at all levels—more so, that the government takes all possible measures toward the aim that such events should not repeat themselves anymore.
