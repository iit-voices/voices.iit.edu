We had no water system in <a class="placename" href="#vothC110" type="camp">Theresienstadt</a>. When sixty-five thousand people are crowded together in such a small locality, and are dependent on well to obtain their water from wells, so it is obvious that, due to the communication between the various sections, a number of wells were contaminated in a short time with typhoid fever. That was the reason [??] that we had to close a number of wells, and had to undertake to extend the existing water pipe system. That was really a great piece of public works created under Jewish inventiveness and by Jewish labor. They expanded the water supply system, and have achieved [a condition] that we not only produced for the people good drinking water or, at least, not objectionable drinking water, but that also the toilet installations could be flushed with water, so that these unhygienic conditions were removed.</span>

The nights, therefor, were painful. I, for example, one night had not enough air to breath.

Everything was to be put in order, everything had to be shined up, painted up; the streets had to be kept meticulously clean. No scrap of paper could be thrown away. It became, indeed, a rather clean little town. The armories had to be vacated in part because the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> had transferred to <a class="placename" href="#vothC110" type="camp">Theresienstadt</a> a large central archive from somewhere in Germany, a whole card index of the members of the Party.</span>

On orders of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</a> was compelled to organize a Jewish orchestra. There were found enough musicians, the instruments were obtained, and concerts were given in the cafe hall. Within the landscapes of the park which were laid out on the grounds in order to embellish the city, was erected an orchestra pavilion, where concerts were given nightly, which by the way, were not bad at all . . . where the Jewish musicians did very well . . . very well indeed. Also . . . all activities directed toward an agreeable leisure time for the workers and the old people, and so arrangements were made for lectures, there were formed committees for the utilization of the leisure time, lecture societies, language courses were given, and were given scientific lectures in all possible fields, in the technological field, in the medical field, in the religious field. There was a quite active life [interest] in all these fields. Stage plays were given, the actors got together. In the attics stages were erected, arrangements made for the audiences, and so a . . . a quite active spiritual life got slowly, and slowly in swing.

                By November 24, 1941 the heart of Theresienstadt was turned into a walled ghetto. To the outside it was presented by the Nazis as a model Jewish settlement, but in reality it was a concentration camp. Theresienstadt was also used as a transit camp for European Jews en route to Auschwitz.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
