Nothing interested me, neither money nor clothes interested me. To this day all this does not interest me.[Footnote: The interviewer recollects that she was very neatly dressed and groomed with a definite touch of French feminine standards.] I have absolutely no needs. I only have certain needs of a psychological nature. At that time I wanted to forget about the past. I wanted to work with my entire soul, so that there should not remain any time for thinking [brooding] and memories, so as able to forget everything, all that I had lost, all that I had lived through in the past. And nothing else mattered to me. And I would have remained [there]. The work that I was doing in the field of constructive ability was designated as a doctoral project. I have a master's degree in psychology, but I had not yet made my doctorate, and I would have completed it, if not for this accident. I would have completed the work, but they came to me from the Jewish Committee with an appeal to take care of the children who are returning now from various camps, from <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>, whom people are bringing to the Committee, and to...and that many Jewish children have remained alive, and that they are roaming, rambling, have no roof over their heads, that something must be done for them, that I should organize a home for children, one of the first homes in Poland.

That means to work through the vacation, through June and July, and in August to return to my scientific work at the university. And such an agreement I made with the president of the Jewish Committee in <a class="placename" href="#vothL135">Cracow</a>, with Doctor Kupferberg. And then as soon as I began the work with these children I could not tear myself away from them any more. My presence...presence was indispensible in order to maintain the home, because we were struggling against tremendous difficulties. The children which we received, which were brought to the Committee ' and I was present at it from the first moment ' were in a terrible state, terrible. They were so starved, so sickly, so covered with lice, so neglected morally, physically, and intellectually, that a truly tremendous job arose before us. Moreover, we had absolutely no financial means. We had absolutely no budget for all that. The Jewish Committee had hardly any financial means at its disposal, and it was surrounded every day by crowds of various people who were returning from camps. What could be done for these people? Barely a little soup. And these people cursed us all, and we really did not have anything to give them. The <a class="term" href="#vothG_ajdc">Joint</a> was not yet working in Poland. And the means which we did receive from the impoverished Polish government were minimal, completely out...out of proportion to the needs. It was necessary then.... We decided to organize a home in <a class="placename" href="#vothL155">Zakopane</a>. <a class="placename" href="#vothL155">Zakopane</a> is a resort, especially for tubercular children. <a class="placename" href="#vothL155">Zakopane</a> is a place situated amid mountains, a very beautiful spot, but known for its anti-Semitism yet from before the war. There we rented a very beautiful villa, and we renovated it, because it was ruined after the Germans. And there I went with the first group of children. The home had a capacity of a hundred children, and I always had the full number of children, even more. There were times when I had a hundred and seven, a hundred and ten children. In addition, they sent me older youths with sick lungs, people who had survived camps, whom...who had to be saved. There were some who were already...</span>

These people I placed in Polish sanatoriums, because being seriously ill with lung diseases they could not live together with the children. But there in those sanatoriums raged a frightful hunger, and therefore we would also carry food to them every day. And usually [?] I took care of everyone. I brought them underwear. I brought them medicines. I visited them, and I can say that...that I saved the lives of several people from among those youths. Besides that, we did an enormous job with our children. It was very difficult for me to get personnel. There were absolutely no [suitable] people. There was no one. I picked out a certain group of women who had returned from the <a class="term" href="#vothG_lager">Lager</a>
                        <a class="placename" href="#vothC4" type="camp">Auschwitz</a>. These women had lost everybody. They had lost their husbands. They had lost their children. I said to them a few words. I told them that if they do not have their own children to take to their hearts, these children, these children who do not have their parents, that we should become true mothers to these children, that we should not work for ourselves, that we should not work for profit, that we should not work at it like at a trade, let us truly consecrate ourselves to these children. This will be the aim of our...our lives. And indeed our entire work was one great sacrifice. Our home was not a boarding home. It was not even a children's home. It was one big family. We worked from morning till night. We were under terrible stress. I was suffering enormously. I was traveling constantly. I did not have the means to support these children. The Committee was in constant financial predicaments. They never had any money. I called on various private people, begging them for money to maintain the children. I traveled to <a class="placename" href="#vothL79">Warsaw</a> to the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ajdc">Joint</a>. And they were not allowed to give us money. And in spite of everything, the director of the <a class="term" href="#vothG_ajdc">Joint</a>, Guzik always helped me, even though 'illegally,' so as not to throw these children out in the street. Every...every...every week, every few days I was faced with an alternative of closing down the home and finding the children themselves out in the street. I did not have any idea how we would live through the next week, in such a financial strait we found ourselves. Moreover, we were surrounded by a wave of such anti-Semitism that is impossible to describe. The children could not go out on the street at all. They were hit with stones on the head. When I sent three boys to movies, other Polish boys sitting behind them were threatening them all the time to stick a knife in their backs. I could not send the children to Polish schools, because there they were so persecuted and insulted. The clerks, the officials of the supply service, did not want to give us any rations. They constantly tried to cut them down to the utmost. I really did not have anything to give the children to eat. I had to fight on all sides. Wherever I went I heard only anti-Semitic jeers. I was...I was a person hated by the Poles in <a class="placename" href="#vothL155">Zakopane</a>, because I was constantly defending our right. In the end I saw that the wave of anti-Semitism was growing so terribly...and not far from us there was a second children's home. It was in Wrotka, about thirty kilometers from us. In Wrotka lived children who were totally sick. It was a quarantine [preventorium?]. That children's home in Wrotka was shot up three times.

Then, in the forest when they knew that the army was to pass by, they would loosen up the rails, and the like. I had many such boys who had fought with the <a class="term" href="#vothG_partisans">partisans</a>. They have gone through an awful lot. Now [when the war was over] these boys were coming to the Jewish Committee [for help]. A part of the children had lived among peasants. These children have lived through...the peasants did not know that they were Jewish children. These children worked very hard there. They were shepherds, farm hands, tended cattle, horses, and did all sorts of farm jobs. They worked very hard and starved a great deal. A part of the children were hidden in various hiding places. I have children here who had been in hiding places. They sat in wardrobes. I have here a little girl who sat two and a half years in a wardrobe. A tiny child three years old, this child was completely unable to walk or talk when it came out of that wardrobe. It was completely emaciated, covered with lice. By some miracle we pulled this child out of that wardrobe, because...because the woman who kept her in that wardrobe -- it was in <a class="placename" href="#vothL79">Warsaw</a> -- had left the dwelling, locked the door, and did not return any more. And this child had been there already two days without food. And then we found out about it, and we pulled this child out through the window. I have children who sat in hiding places for a year or two with the legs doubled up, so that when they eventually left these hiding places they had complete atrophy of the leg muscles. They were completely unable to walk. A part of the children were hidden in Polish cloisters. But in the cloisters the children were converted, and later on the priests did not want to return these children. Only from a few orphanages where there reigned a terrible hunger, where they could not feed the children, even the Polish children, there they first of all tried to get rid of the Jewish children, and they would bring them to the Committee.</span>

However, it could be questioned whether such claims should be made against the Jewish charitable organizations rather than against the state. Be it as it may, the keeping of these children as pawns to secure payment cannot help but arouse indignation and can be understood only in the light of chaos and devastation which reigned at the time immediately following the armistice. Another instance of deculturation...?],that the Jews...the Jews, of course, have a lot of money. So then payment was demanded for these children. Subsequently larger payments were demanded. And then the children were even sent to extort [money] from us. That means that children were sent, and these children would demand money for their Polish guardians.

These children had it very bad, because the conditions there were no good, the more so during the war. Later on, when <a class="placename" href="#vothL79">Warsaw</a> was being bombed, the home was evacuated and among...and these children were distributed all over the countryside. And these children were placed in a cloister, in a Catholic institution named after Saint Andrew Bobol, in <a class="placename" href="#vothL155">Zakopane</a>. This intitution made a terrible impression on me. Dirty [Word not clear. The word sounds like priests. If this be so, it characterizes the bitter cleavage between certain religious groups in Poland badly deepened by the Nazi occupation.], a crowd of tiny children [not all Jewish; see below], all shaven to the skin, all in striped suits, all dressed the same. When I came to these children I brought along with me pastries and candy. The mother superior permitted me to distribute the candy myself. When I appeared with the candy before the children, these children threw themselves at me with such violence, and screamed so frightfully, and one child...and cried. One child trampled on the other, and one pushed away the other that....These children pushed me completely against the wall, and the mother superior had to rescue me. And these were all children from two to five years old. Such small children. There were about eighty such small children, all in one room. I was in great dispair when I saw this. I understood that these children were badly starved, that they never see any candy, that this is perhaps the first time that they have seen any candy, and were...and that is why they threw themselves with such violence, and that these children are completely wild from hunger. I felt very sorry for these children. [Noise on the wire of children apparently playing in the yard.] I begged the mother superior to show me the Jewish children. She showed me these children. At first only three boys. I noticed that they were much smaller, [that they] looked even worse than the other children. The sister herself told me that she was very much surprised but the Jewish children were doubtlessly faring still worse than the others. Then she told me that she will not give me these children without a special permit from Wars-...the city authorities of <a class="placename" href="#vothL79">Warsaw</a>. In view of that, I sent a certain lady to <a class="placename" href="#vothL79">Warsaw</a>. I did not go myself, because I was supposed to leave in three days with all the children for France. We had very little time. But I gave her the address of some very good friends of mine who were to take care of securing the permit for the release of the children. This lady, without a moment of hesitation, left half an hour later for <a class="placename" href="#vothL79">Warsaw</a>. [Chuckle.] And the journey from us to <a class="placename" href="#vothL79">Warsaw</a> took her twenty-two hours in terrible conditions. Twenty-two hours there and twenty-two hours back. Two days she went without sleep, and she brought me the permit. Then I scraped together some money from private sources, and I loaded as many provisions as I could from my larder, and I drove over to them there with money, with provisions, and with this permit. The nuns were very surprised that it took so little time. They had not expected that I would receive the permit, because it was not so easy to get these things. And I arranged it, because I had many friends in the Polish government in <a class="placename" href="#vothL79">Warsaw</a>. And then they started to find objections. They argued that they will return them later, that the priest is against it, seeing that these children are converted, that they are already Catholic children, that we will again make Jews out of them, that....They resisted as much as they could. Then they told me that the children are dirty, that they will wash them first, that they will bathe them first, that they will comb them first. I, however, implored them to release these children immediately, because...and that we will already take care of these children, that we will wash and bathe them ourselves. However, I had brought so many gifts for [all] the children, so much food and money, and [together with] the permit...all that together...in the presence of all that they could not resist any more and finally returned the children to me. Then on sleds I brought the five children in my own arms. When I brought these five children and I showed these children to my children, the ones whom I had from before, all the children cried. Thus did these children look. All were barefoot, and this was in February, at the height of winter. And winter in <a class="placename" href="#vothL155">Zakopane</a> is very severe. None of them had shoes. None had coats. They were bund-...in rags, bundled up. The children all had colds. All were wetting themselves. All shaven to the skin, emaciated, just skin and bones. They constantly cried. They were terribly scared of everything. They were scared of a horse. They were scared of a dog. They were scared of a cat. They were completely scared of people. If something was said to them they would become hysterical, they would begin to scream in terror. They absolutely did not know what meat was. They had never in their lives eaten meat. They did not know what chocolate was. They did not know what candy was. They had never had anything sweet in their mouths. They did not even know how to eat these things. They only had been fed potatoes, and occasionally some mush, and black coffee. These children were two, three years old and had never been out on the street, did not go out at all, because they had no clothes, and in <a class="placename" href="#vothL155">Zakopane</a> the winter lasts a long time. The children were completely wild. I did not even believe that anything would become of these children. I assumed that....There were three boys and two girls. Besides that, they had scrofula and...and were sick. I feared that they would not thrive, that at least two, three would die on me. My children as well as all of us surrounded these children with utmost care. The children brought them everything they had. Apples, chocolate -- they gave them all their food. Immediately we named them the 'Bobols.' They amused them, danced, sang to them, rocked them, carried them on their hands. Everybody carried these children [around]. Unfortunately we had very little time to give these children the proper care, because we had at once to prepare for the journey to France. And this journey was very difficult and took three weeks, from <a class="placename" href="#vothL155">Zakopane</a> to <a class="placename" href="#vothL13">Paris</a>, because we crossed the Polish border illegally. And altogether we were struggling with various difficulties. [However,] these children are now no less enchanting. It is a pity....I could prove with pictures of these children....These children are chubby. One of the boys, when he came to me, weighed seven kilos. Now he weighs fifteen kilos. They are very intelligent children, very clever, and very beautiful. Everyone who comes here wants to take them from me, but I cannot give up these children. I am especially devoted [to them], and we all are devoted [to them]. These children are as if they belonged to us. They belong to the entire Jewish people. I believe that their place is in Palestine. </span>

Two of them are most intelligent. They are thriving beautifully. They are very handsome, and have gained very much weight, and are thriving wonderfully. Such is the history of our five children named the 'Bobols.' All of us love them very much. They are our youngest children. And they are literally our children. All these children call me mama. Although they have no conception of the word mother, still they feel that I love them very much. All in all, they have it good with us. We spoil them. They are a little spoiled, but we cannot resist their charm. All the other children feel a close attachement [to them]. They saw how these children looked once and how they look now. We observe them every day, how beautifully they are thriving with us, and that is why we are so attached to them. This is the story of five children, but each and every one of our children has such a tragic story. Each girl, each boy, every one of them has gone through all of hell. One could write volumes full and not [just] one interview in order to write the full story of the children. </span>

And it is our deep desire that all of us continue staying together, because we comprise one family. This is not a [children's] home, this is not an institution. This is one family. My feelings toward these children, toward all these children, is the same as the feeling of a mother toward her own born children. Maybe even...even deeper. I protect these children, and I will go on protecting them as long as they will be with me. Always. But I would like to be ...remain with them for ever. [Chuckle.] I would like to see them get married, to have already my own 'grand-children.' I do not have a family of my own. I have nobody here. I have only one brother who remained in Poland, but who has his own ideological work. He is a communist, but I am not. I am a <a class="term" href="#vothG_zionist">Zionist</a>. We differ in views. My entire family are these children here and this house. I would not like to be separated from them any more. The children among themselves are also very close. They love each other very much. They live like brothers and sisters. The older children pamper and play with the younger children. For instance, when we went once on an excursion to the beach and we had to walk several kilometers, the children begged that these tots, the 'Bobols,' who could not go on foot, be also taken along, so they should not remain home alone...</span>

And such a procession passed through the streets [chuckle] of a small French town. People saw it and laughed. This is very moving, because it shows how close the older children are to the young, how very much they love them. Not one proof have we had which showed us that the feeling of solidarity...and mutual attachment is very strong in our children, that they all love one another very much. If sometimes they do quarrel among themselves, it is the same as a quarrel of a brother and a sister. Because this happens even in one's own family. We desire to live in Palestine. All the children desire that, and we, too, and I most of all. We have enough of wandering, enough of roaming. We do not want to be insulted any more with the name of Jew. We want to be proud of it, and we are proud of it, that we are Jews. We want to live in our own country, on our own land. We want to be citizens of our own country. We want to develop free and unimpeded. It is not important to us that the living conditions there are harder than, for instance, in France. It is not important to us that it is very difficult there now, that there is now a battle going on. We want to fight for our father-land, for our country. We long to be on our own land. We lost everything. We have no family. We have no parents. We have no children. We have no wives. The children have no parents. We long to have our own land. This is for us...our aim. The children are learning a lot of Hebrew, because they know this is their native language. And all dream about getting to Palestine. I requested that certificates be allotted to us as soon as possible. We would not want to get to Palestine by an illegal route, and we cannot that way [illegally], because we have tiny children with us with whom we cannot risk to be taken to concentration camps. Because these children have gone through enough already, and these children are none too healthy. And therefore we would like to obtain certificates. We were promised certificates as soon as possible. Unfortunately this does not depend on us but on the political situation. When the certificates will be available I hope that our party will be among the first.</span>
