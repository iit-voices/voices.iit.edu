And there were various harassments. There were all kinds of incidents. On the streets one had to take off his hat, and greet [them]. There was no objection against it, but there were individual Germans who would beat Jews for not having taken off their hats. Some Germans demanded that the Jews should not walk on the sidewalks, they should step aside, they should walk in the middle of the street. If a Jew did not step aside he would be forced on his knees, they loaded bricks on him [??] and so he had to stand as long as it was their pleasure. Again they were beating [people]. They would catch intelligent people on the street for various labors. They especially looked for the intelligent, for the better dressed. They were, would tear off on the street cold weather clothing, fur coats. They started a terrible persecution of Jews, a most violent. Then they started abusing [??] they took away the better apartments from the Jews, the nicer ones. Subsequently they took them also from the Poles. But mostly from the Jews. The Jews were thrown out first from better apartments. They took away the furniture."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "431.916","u": "What?"},    {"who": "Rachel Gurmanova", "start": "432.807","u": "They took away the furniture.

They were coming like people half dead. It was difficult to recognize them, beaten [nearly] murdered, swollen. In a horrible condition, mostly they have all died out."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "581.434","u": "So."},    {"who": "Rachel Gurmanova", "start": "583.843","u": "Subsequently there was a general order to register all men. Everybody was compelled to go to work. And in general everybody had to procure a work certificate. If one had no work certificate, he would not get a bread card and he would be sent out to some kind of work camp. Then they started organizing big shops. [She uses the word like in English: shop.

And again started the cannon fire, again worries, we were sitting there. And it was not comfortable. There arrived also a sister of the friend of my woman friend&#39;s brother.
