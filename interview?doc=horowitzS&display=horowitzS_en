All day long people thought only about one thing, to save one's life. Days passed when people forgot even about the need to eat. There passed entire days in which one neither ate nor slept. And when one became tired, one lay down on the grass. Once it rained constantly for three days. And it became so muddy that afterwards, when we got up, people got lost. We couldn't find one another. Thus we were submerged, covered with mud. That is how we slept in a forest. And at the beginning the food consisted of mushrooms from the trees, around the trees, on the ground.

To tell the truth, if not helped by America the Shaarith Haplatim would not be able to exist, and the surviving Jews would have simply fallen apart. Thanks to their initiative, their help in every sphere, that really strengthened the broken up, surviving Jews of the Shaarith Haplatim, and this gives them the possibility of existing anew and to begin living anew. But I want to tell our American brothers, they should know that the aid that they are giving is really very big. The aid is very important. But an adjustment we have not achieved yet. We wander from one country to another, whether we . . . we are sitting here in <a class="term" href="#vothG_kibbutz">Kibbutz</a>, or others in other places.
