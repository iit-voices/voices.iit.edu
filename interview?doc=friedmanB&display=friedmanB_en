I came to the conclusion, I have there a brother and I must go to him. And what will happen further I do not know. And on the train still I had heard that the Slovaks were rendering resistance. And coming as far as the lager at night, it was around twelve o'clock, the whole lager is awake. No one sleeps, and there is a stirring mood.</span>

But something different was happening here. The uprising which had been organized so that the whole of Slovakia should be liberated had partly succeeded. That means in the region of <a class="placename" href="#vothL448">Banska-Bystrica</a>. There came all the <a class="term" href="#vothG_partisans">partisans</a> who had been organized from before, together with Russians, and they have disarmed the troops of the surrounding region, and . . . and . . . and after, generally there surrendered one garrison after another, of the towns. In <a class="placename" href="#vothL448">Banska-Bystrica</a> they captured the radio station and announced that there is a free Czechoslovakia. This was on about the 24th.
