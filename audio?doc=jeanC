Nous &#195;tions command&#195;s exactement comme dans l&#39;arm&#195;e. Nous avions des armes qui nous &#195;taient parachut&#195;es par les Anglais, et celles que nous pouvions r&#195;cup&#195;rer sur les Allemands que nous prenions prisonniers. Nous &#195;tions command&#195;s par un groupement qui se trouvait &#195; Clermont-Ferrand, et dont nous d&#195;fendions, au Maquis o&#195; j&#39;&#195;tais, et nous &#195;tions tr&#195;s bien d&#39;ailleurs command&#195;s par des chefs comp&#195;tents qui avaient d&#195;j&#195; fait la guerre et qui prenaient leur travail tr&#195;s au s&#195;rieux. Nous &#195;tions, nous &#195;tions environ, dans ce Maquis dont je faisais partie, environ trois cents et moi je me trouvais au poste de commandement. J&#39;avais l&#39;avantage d&#39;&#195;tre chauffeur du commandant, ce qui me donnait beaucoup d&#39;avantages par rapport &#195; mes camarades qui, des trois quarts du temps, couchaient dans des bois et n&#39;avaient pas le m&#195;me confort. Je vais vous parler de la phase finale de notre Maquis, c&#39;est-&#195;-dire la prise de Thiers, la capitale de la coutellerie. Nous avons &#195;t&#195; attaqu&#195;s au poste de commandement le 23 ao&#195;t 1944 par un d&#195;tachement allemand d&#39;SS que nous l&#39;avons su plus tard avait l&#39;ordre de nous exterminer co&#195;te que co&#195;te.

Moi, je ne suis venu que par la suite et mes camarades sont partis d&#39;abord, &#195; 150 le 24 ao&#195;t ou le 23, je ne me rappelle pas exactement, pour attaquer Thiers. Ils &#195;taient environ 150 hommes pour prendre les deux ou trois cents Allemands qui se trouvaient l&#195;-bas. Nous avons attaqu&#195; Thiers par le nord et l&#39;est. La bataille &#195;tait tr&#195;s dure. Elle a dur&#195; d&#39;ailleurs une journ&#195;e et demie, et nous avons eu onze morts chez nous et une quarantaine chez les Allemands. Et en fin de compte, leurs chefs se sont rendus sans conditions . . . nous en a fait prisonniers, ainsi que quelques miliciens qui se trouvaient avec eux. Par la suite nous avons pu r&#195;cup&#195;rer dans les Allemands qui se trouvaient l&#195; cinq d&#39;entre eux qui avaient massacr&#195; des camarades de chez nous et nous les avons fusill&#195;s, ainsi que les sept miliciens qui se trouvaient l&#195;."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "305.157","u": "[In English] [interrupts] All right, now . . . continuez."},    {"who": "Charles Jean", "start": "311.830","u": "[In French] Apr&#195;s, c&#39;est &#195; ce moment que la garde du Mar&#195;chal sont venus nous rejoindre pour lib&#195;rer le reste du secteur qui se trouvait encore quelques Allemands.

I was working, and then I was captured again by the Germans during the month of April &#39;43, to go work in Germany. I escaped once again from Cravant in Yonne.

We were mostly young men under the orders of a Commander, with a whole staff. We were commanded exactly as if it were the army. We had arms that were parachuted to us by the English, as well as those arms that we were able to take off of the Germans that we took prisoner. We were commanded by a group from Clermont-Ferrand, which we defended, in the resistance movement to which I belonged, and we were actually very well commanded by competent leaders who had already been in the war and who took their jobs very seriously. We were . . . there were approximately three hundred of us in the resistance to which I belonged. Around three hundred and I was working at the command post. I was fortunate to be the Commander&#39;s driver, a job which gave me a lot of advantages over my comrades who, three-quarters of the time, slept in the woods and didn&#39;t have the same comforts I had. I&#39;m going to tell you about the final phase of our resistance, when we took Thiers, a city known as the main cutlery producer in France. We were attacked at the command post on August 23, 1944 by a German SS detachment that we later learned had orders to exterminate us at any cost. We actually resisted pretty well, since the Germans were unable to take us. And their Commander, in retaliation, decided on that particular day to attack Thiers. About a hundred and fifty of us went into battle. I arrived later, following my hundred and fifty comrades, on the 24th or 23rd of August, I don&#39;t remember exactly, to attack Thiers. We had about a hundred and fifty men to take on the two or three hundred Germans who were there. We attacked Thiers from the north and the east. The battle was very hard. It lasted actually a day and a half and we counted eleven dead on our side and around forty on the German side. In the end, their leaders surrendered unconditionally. We took them prisoner, as well as a few of the militia that were with them. After that, we were able to pick out five men among the Germans who were there, five of them who had slaughtered some of our own comrades, and we shot them, along with the seven militiamen who were with them."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "305.157","u": "[In English] [interrupts] All right, now . . . continuez."},    {"who": "Charles Jean", "start": "311.830","u": "[In French] Afterwards, that was when the Marshal&#39;s Guard joined forces with us to liberate the rest of the sector where there were still a few Germans.

We did the same for tobacco as well as for automobiles. As for automobiles, we tried as often as possible to take cars from collaborators. I myself took General Ferr&#195;&#39;s [?] car, who was the one who commanded the mobile guards in Vichy. And since he was a known collaborator, I took his car. Or as we say in the Resistance, I &#34;ripped off&#34; his car in Vichy, and I turned it in to the Resistance, which was very helpful."},    {"who": "David Boder", "start": "653.827","u": "[In English] Yes, now, here is another question.

Nous &#195;tions command&#195;s exactement comme dans l&#39;arm&#195;e. Nous avions des armes qui nous &#195;taient parachut&#195;es par les Anglais, et celles que nous pouvions r&#195;cup&#195;rer sur les Allemands que nous prenions prisonniers. Nous &#195;tions command&#195;s par un groupement qui se trouvait &#195; Clermont-Ferrand, et dont nous d&#195;fendions, au Maquis o&#195; j&#39;&#195;tais, et nous &#195;tions tr&#195;s bien d&#39;ailleurs command&#195;s par des chefs comp&#195;tents qui avaient d&#195;j&#195; fait la guerre et qui prenaient leur travail tr&#195;s au s&#195;rieux. Nous &#195;tions, nous &#195;tions environ, dans ce Maquis dont je faisais partie, environ trois cents et moi je me trouvais au poste de commandement. J&#39;avais l&#39;avantage d&#39;&#195;tre chauffeur du commandant, ce qui me donnait beaucoup d&#39;avantages par rapport &#195; mes camarades qui, des trois quarts du temps, couchaient dans des bois et n&#39;avaient pas le m&#195;me confort. Je vais vous parler de la phase finale de notre Maquis, c&#39;est-&#195;-dire la prise de Thiers, la capitale de la coutellerie. Nous avons &#195;t&#195; attaqu&#195;s au poste de commandement le 23 ao&#195;t 1944 par un d&#195;tachement allemand d&#39;SS que nous l&#39;avons su plus tard avait l&#39;ordre de nous exterminer co&#195;te que co&#195;te. Nous avons r&#195;sist&#195; assez bien d&#39;ailleurs, puisque les Allemands n&#39;ont pas pu nous prendre. Et le Commandant par repr&#195;sailles a d&#195;cid&#195; &#195; ce jour-l&#195; d&#39;attaquer Thiers. Nous sommes partis &#195; 150 environ. Moi, je ne suis venu que par la suite et mes camarades sont partis d&#39;abord, &#195; 150 le 24 ao&#195;t ou le 23, je ne me rappelle pas exactement, pour attaquer Thiers. Ils &#195;taient environ 150 hommes pour prendre les deux ou trois cents Allemands qui se trouvaient l&#195;-bas. Nous avons attaqu&#195; Thiers par le nord et l&#39;est. La bataille &#195;tait tr&#195;s dure. Elle a dur&#195; d&#39;ailleurs une journ&#195;e et demie, et nous avons eu onze morts chez nous et une quarantaine chez les Allemands. Et en fin de compte, leurs chefs se sont rendus sans conditions . . . nous en a fait prisonniers, ainsi que quelques miliciens qui se trouvaient avec eux. Par la suite nous avons pu r&#195;cup&#195;rer dans les Allemands qui se trouvaient l&#195; cinq d&#39;entre eux qui avaient massacr&#195; des camarades de chez nous et nous les avons fusill&#195;s, ainsi que les sept miliciens qui se trouvaient l&#195;.</p>

We were mostly young men under the orders of a Commander, with a whole staff. We were commanded exactly as if it were the army. We had arms that were parachuted to us by the English, as well as those arms that we were able to take off of the Germans that we took prisoner. We were commanded by a group from Clermont-Ferrand, which we defended, in the resistance movement to which I belonged, and we were actually very well commanded by competent leaders who had already been in the war and who took their jobs very seriously. We were . . . there were approximately three hundred of us in the resistance to which I belonged. Around three hundred and I was working at the command post. I was fortunate to be the Commander&#39;s driver, a job which gave me a lot of advantages over my comrades who, three-quarters of the time, slept in the woods and didn&#39;t have the same comforts I had. I&#39;m going to tell you about the final phase of our resistance, when we took Thiers, a city known as the main cutlery producer in France. We were attacked at the command post on August 23, 1944 by a German SS detachment that we later learned had orders to exterminate us at any cost. We actually resisted pretty well, since the Germans were unable to take us. And their Commander, in retaliation, decided on that particular day to attack Thiers. About a hundred and fifty of us went into battle. I arrived later, following my hundred and fifty comrades, on the 24th or 23rd of August, I don&#39;t remember exactly, to attack Thiers. We had about a hundred and fifty men to take on the two or three hundred Germans who were there. We attacked Thiers from the north and the east. The battle was very hard. It lasted actually a day and a half and we counted eleven dead on our side and around forty on the German side. In the end, their leaders surrendered unconditionally. We took them prisoner, as well as a few of the militia that were with them. After that, we were able to pick out five men among the Germans who were there, five of them who had slaughtered some of our own comrades, and we shot them, along with the seven militiamen who were with them.</p>

And we actually organized, for our comrades&#39; wives in a place nearby . . . we organized in a hotel a sort of a shelter to take them in so they wouldn&#39;t be bothered and were under our protection. But the women had no active role with us. There were no women in our service, only the wives of our comrades who were being sheltered nearby.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">[In French] Well, in Auvergne, the people were really nice to us. We basically had everything we needed. We went to the farms for supplies. We didn&#39;t have money, we used to pay . . . we had vouchers. Requisition vouchers that were paid back later. We did the same for tobacco as well as for automobiles. As for automobiles, we tried as often as possible to take cars from collaborators. I myself took General Ferr&#195;&#39;s [?] car, who was the one who commanded the mobile guards in Vichy. And since he was a known collaborator, I took his car. Or as we say in the Resistance, I &#34;ripped off&#34; his car in Vichy, and I turned it in to the Resistance, which was very helpful.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">[In French] Oh, yes, we had radio service. We had a code. Actually, I myself didn&#39;t know the code. The Officer knew it. We used to communicate with London for the parachute drops and most of our arms especially came to us from what we could take off of the Germans. Because the AS [arm&#195;e secr&#195;te: secret army?] was much better equipped with arms than we were ourselves because they were respected and the United Movements of the Resistance were much better armed than we were. We managed on our own, through our own means, you could say.</p>
