In the first place I am sending over my great gratitude for their initiative, for their help to all our brothers of the Shaarith Haplatim. To tell the truth, if not helped by America the Shaarith Haplatim would not be able to exist, and the surviving Jews would have simply fallen apart. Thanks to their initiative, their help in every sphere, that really strengthened the broken up, surviving Jews of the Shaarith Haplatim, and this gives them the possibility of existing anew and to begin living anew. But I want to tell our American brothers, they should know that the aid that they are giving is really very big. The aid is very important. But an adjustment we have not achieved yet. We wander from one country to another, whether we . . . we are sitting here in Kibbutz, or others in other places. But we lead a na vanat [roaming and wandering] life.</p>

                    <p class="utterance">A hard life, and we don&#39;t see the morning before us yet. We don&#39;t see the salvation before us yet. The aim of all of us is Eretz Israel. And at present Eretz Israel is still so complicated. The entry to Eretz Israel is still to complicated with various frustration, with various obstacles. They should know, the American Jews, that indeed they are the only brothers who can save us, who can help us. And they should remember always to be in contact with all the Jews that find themselves in Europe, and to send messengers to every point to become acquainted with the conditions and with what they have to be helped. And to help with something really important, that means, to lead [us] out from Galuth [Diaspora] and to bring [us] into a little safe harbor.</p>
