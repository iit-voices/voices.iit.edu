            The German army crossed the Austrian frontier on March 11, 1938, and two days days later the annexation (Anschluss) of Austria to the Third Reich was proclaimed.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_2"></a>
            Like the Johles's delicatessen, most of the 26,236 Jewish-owned businesses in Austria in March, 1938 were modest enterprises. However, whether large or small, Jewish businesses and Jewish involvement in the Austrian economy was soon brought to a brutal and ruthless end by the Nazis.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_3"></a>
            From the beginning of the German takeover, official Nazi policy towards Austrian Jewry was one of forced emigration. The emigration of Austrian Jewry was directed by the notorious Adolf Eichmann. However, the problem faced by Jews wanting to leave (such as Mrs. Johles) was the frustrating, humiliating and often fruitless endeavor to find a country willing to admit them.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_4"></a>
            Mrs. Johles is speaking of the infamous Kristallnacht (literally, "Crystal Night," also known as the Night of Broken Glass) pogrom which took place on November 9th and 10th, 1938. In addition to the robbery, maltreatment, arrests and outright murder of Jews, the Nazis destroyed forty-two prayer halls and funeral homes in Vienna. Many places of Jewish worship and Jewish institutions in the provinces suffered the same fate.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_5"></a>
            Aachen is located just across the border from Belgium. It was there that the Johles family, including Mr. and Mrs. Johles, their son and thirteen-month-old daughter, sought to cross the border.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_6"></a>
            At that time (late 1938), the declared policy of Nazi Germany towards the Jews was still forced emigration. However, as in the case of the Johles family, Jews leaving German-controlled territory had to leave behind all of their wealth and possessions, which were often the fruits of a lifetime of labor. The most each emigrant could legally take with him or her was ten marks.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_7"></a>
            Translator's Note: Throughout, it is not entirely clear if what is meant is a "committee" or the Jewish "communaut√©/community."
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_8"></a>
            From May 17th, 1940 to July 18th, 1940. The fact that Mrs. Johles remembered these dates so exactly was due in some measure to her concern for her husband's welfare at the time.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_9"></a>
            This is another example of the initiative taken by the Johles family. Instead of waiting to be sent away, they fled to Lyon, the second largest city in France at the time.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_10"></a>
            Mrs. Johles is perhaps speaking here of the policy to deport foreign-born Jews from France (like the Johles family) "to the East." Though it might have been rumored they were being sent to Kiev, the final destination of most was Auschwitz, where they were murdered. Large scale deportations of Jews from France were taking place during the summer of 1942, the time period Mrs. Johles is speaking about.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_11"></a>
            Translator's note: Mrs. Johles possibly means the official residence of the "pr√©fet", the prefect of a d√©partements.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_12"></a>
            This is a mountainous area in southwestern France near Switzerland. Mining operations were conducted there. Mr. Johles was in a forced labor camp in the department of Haute Savoie located near the town of St. Julien.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_13"></a>
            Mrs. Johles's husband might have been told that he was going to war in order to deceive him. Deportation meant being sent to Auschwitz or another extermination center. As a foreign Jew of Polish nationality, Mr. Johles was particularly vulnerable to deportation.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_14"></a>
            It is not entirely clear why Mrs. Johles was reluctant to accept help from the Vichy government. Perhaps she was afraid that the aid could be used as a means of forcing Mr. Johles to have his hernia surgery in St. Julien rather than in Lyon near his family. As it turned out, he was operated on in St. Julien anyway.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_15"></a>
            French for "highway." Mrs. Johles might refer to people being stopped on the highway by the police.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_16"></a>
            Mrs. Johles might mean that because he was recuperating from surgery he was exempt from any kind of military service.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_17"></a>
            This is yet another example of an act of resistance on the part of the Johles family. Instead of returning to the alpine forced labor camp, Mr. Johles and his family at first went into hiding and then chose to attempt to flee to neutral Switzerland.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_18"></a>
            Later in the interview, Mrs. Johles returns to the account of her family's escape to Switzerland. The Johles family was accompanied on their escape by Mr. Johles's sister and her child.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_19"></a>
            The Johles family was very fortunate in being able to find refuge in Switzerland, though the reason they were admitted is not clear. Mrs. Johles later attributes it mostly to luck. Some 20,000 who sought asylum in Switzerland were not as lucky. They were refused admittance, which cost many their lives. However, it should be noted that there were some Swiss institutions and individuals who were adamantly opposed to their government's restrictive immigration policies and were determined to help the refugees.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_20"></a>
            The Swiss central government and Swiss cantons offered relatively little help to the refugees. They were helped by the Swiss Jewish community and organizations such as the Joint. It becomes clear from Mrs. Johles's interview that life was far from easy even for those Jews who were able to escape to Switzerland.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_21"></a>
            Some Jewish refugees were separated from their families and sent to labor camps in Switzerland. In the case of Mr. Johles, the camp was near Montreux, located at the eastern end of Lake Geneva.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_22"></a>
            It is somewhat questionable that Mrs. Johles's son made aliyah ("to go up," a term for Jewish immigration into Palestine) legally in 1945, although it is possible that he was among the 1,500 Jewish refugees whom the British, then in control of Palestine, allowed to enter each month. Most Jewish immigrants to Palestine in the immediate post-war years came on Aliyah Bet, that is illegally.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_23"></a>
            The highly restrictive British immigration policies in effect at the time were undoubtedly a key reason for Mrs. Johles's pessimism.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_24"></a>
            She might be referring to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_25"></a>
            Highly restrictive and racist American quotas for refugees were still in effect in 1946. The Johles family had an affidavit, a sworn statement from their American sponsor that they would not become public charges, and a visa, but since they were Polish nationals, they were under that country's quota.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_26"></a>
            As noted, the quota was small due to the official quota system in the United States at the time. Bureaucratic red tape‚Äî"paper walls"‚Äîalso did much to hinder would-be immigrants, as seen in the case of Mrs. Johles's family.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_27"></a>
            Mrs. Johles is returning to the story of how her family and her sister-in-law and niece crossed the Swiss border in late December 1942. Annecy is a French town close to the Swiss border.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_28"></a>
            The excuse for being in Annecy was that Mr. Johles was on the way to the St. Julien hospital where he had his hernia surgery so that his bandages could be changed. He carried with him a letter of confirmation from the St. Julien hospital.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_29"></a>
             She is possibly refering to the letter of confirmation from the hospital.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_30"></a>
            The "little girl" Mrs. Johles is referring was their daughter.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_31"></a>
            The Swiss guide (Fr. passeur) was never further identified by Mrs. Johles. There were a number of guides who had been professional smugglers before the war, and so knew the routes across the French-Swiss frontier.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_32"></a>
            Translator's note: In German, she says "Gardemobilisten"; this is not a German word but might either mean "Gendarme" or a member of some type of guard/garde; in other words, a type of police force.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_33"></a>
            The "French soldier" Mrs. Johles refers to is the twenty-three-year-old son of the other family with them who had been hiding in a tree. This young man's mother begged the French Moroccan policeman ("soldier") to take pity on them because he had been in the French army.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_34"></a>
            Mrs. Johles is referring to the group of Vichy policemen. Most fortunately, they did not arrest the group attempting to cross the border, or the guide and his family, though they had to be bribed to let them go.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_35"></a>
            Though the Swiss man Mrs. Johles is speaking about contacted the Swiss police‚Äîwhose orders at the time were to ruthlessly enforce Swiss policies regarding refugee entry‚Äîthere were courageous Swiss individuals who sheltered refugees, did not report them to the police and, with the aid of Swiss Jewish rescue networks, helped them move out of the border zone and into the interior of the country. Indeed, some 25,000 refugees did find sanctuary in Switzerland.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_36"></a>
            It took a great deal of courage in the dead of winter of 1942-'43 for this family to make four attempts to cross the border. Fortunately, the last attempt was successful. It was only towards the end of the war (when it was clear that Germany would be defeated) that Swiss border crossing policies eased somewhat.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_37"></a>
            Mrs. Johles might mean that he is a partner (compagnon) in the fur business.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_38"></a>
            What Mrs. Johles might mean is that since she attended the wedding of her niece in Vienna, she is legally married.
        </li>
                <li>
            <a name="note_39"></a>
            In the wake of the German occupation of the entirety of France in November 1942, the persecution of Jews in the large city of Toulouse, located in southwestern France on the Garonne river, increased. Some 6,400 were arrested and deported from Toulouse and the surrounding areas. The majority, like Mrs. Johles's brother and his family, were foreign Jews. Nearly every one of those deported were murdered.

Vichy France was that part of France not occupied by German troops until November 1942. Authoritarian and collaborationist, the Vichy regime cooperated with the Germans even after they had moved to the unoccupied zone in November 1942. It imprisoned some 135,000 people, interned another 70,000, deported some 76,000 Jews, and sent 650,000 French workers to Germany.

            Like the Johles's delicatessen, most of the 26,236 Jewish-owned businesses in Austria in March, 1938 were modest enterprises. However, whether large or small, Jewish businesses and Jewish involvement in the Austrian economy was soon brought to a brutal and ruthless end by the Nazis.

            From the beginning of the German takeover, official Nazi policy towards Austrian Jewry was one of forced emigration. The emigration of Austrian Jewry was directed by the notorious Adolf Eichmann. However, the problem faced by Jews wanting to leave (such as Mrs. Johles) was the frustrating, humiliating and often fruitless endeavor to find a country willing to admit them.

            Mrs. Johles is speaking of the infamous Kristallnacht (literally, "Crystal Night," also known as the Night of Broken Glass) pogrom which took place on November 9th and 10th, 1938. In addition to the robbery, maltreatment, arrests and outright murder of Jews, the Nazis destroyed forty-two prayer halls and funeral homes in Vienna. Many places of Jewish worship and Jewish institutions in the provinces suffered the same fate.

            At that time (late 1938), the declared policy of Nazi Germany towards the Jews was still forced emigration. However, as in the case of the Johles family, Jews leaving German-controlled territory had to leave behind all of their wealth and possessions, which were often the fruits of a lifetime of labor. The most each emigrant could legally take with him or her was ten marks.

            Mrs. Johles is perhaps speaking here of the policy to deport foreign-born Jews from France (like the Johles family) "to the East." Though it might have been rumored they were being sent to Kiev, the final destination of most was Auschwitz, where they were murdered. Large scale deportations of Jews from France were taking place during the summer of 1942, the time period Mrs. Johles is speaking about.

            It is not entirely clear why Mrs. Johles was reluctant to accept help from the Vichy government. Perhaps she was afraid that the aid could be used as a means of forcing Mr. Johles to have his hernia surgery in St. Julien rather than in Lyon near his family.

            The Johles family was very fortunate in being able to find refuge in Switzerland, though the reason they were admitted is not clear. Mrs. Johles later attributes it mostly to luck. Some 20,000 who sought asylum in Switzerland were not as lucky. They were refused admittance, which cost many their lives. However, it should be noted that there were some Swiss institutions and individuals who were adamantly opposed to their government's restrictive immigration policies and were determined to help the refugees.

            It is somewhat questionable that Mrs. Johles's son made aliyah ("to go up," a term for Jewish immigration into Palestine) legally in 1945, although it is possible that he was among the 1,500 Jewish refugees whom the British, then in control of Palestine, allowed to enter each month. Most Jewish immigrants to Palestine in the immediate post-war years came on Aliyah Bet, that is illegally.

            The highly restrictive British immigration policies in effect at the time were undoubtedly a key reason for Mrs. Johles's pessimism.

            Highly restrictive and racist American quotas for refugees were still in effect in 1946. The Johles family had an affidavit, a sworn statement from their American sponsor that they would not become public charges, and a visa, but since they were Polish nationals, they were under that country's quota.

            As noted, the quota was small due to the official quota system in the United States at the time. Bureaucratic red tape‚Äî"paper walls"‚Äîalso did much to hinder would-be immigrants, as seen in the case of Mrs. Johles's family.

            Mrs. Johles is returning to the story of how her family and her sister-in-law and niece crossed the Swiss border in late December 1942. Annecy is a French town close to the Swiss border.

            The excuse for being in Annecy was that Mr. Johles was on the way to the St. Julien hospital where he had his hernia surgery so that his bandages could be changed. He carried with him a letter of confirmation from the St. Julien hospital.

            The Swiss guide (Fr. passeur) was never further identified by Mrs. Johles. There were a number of guides who had been professional smugglers before the war, and so knew the routes across the French-Swiss frontier.

            The "French soldier" Mrs. Johles refers to is the twenty-three-year-old son of the other family with them who had been hiding in a tree. This young man's mother begged the French Moroccan policeman ("soldier") to take pity on them because he had been in the French army.

            Though the Swiss man Mrs. Johles is speaking about contacted the Swiss police‚Äîwhose orders at the time were to ruthlessly enforce Swiss policies regarding refugee entry‚Äîthere were courageous Swiss individuals who sheltered refugees, did not report them to the police and, with the aid of Swiss Jewish rescue networks, helped them move out of the border zone and into the interior of the country. Indeed, some 25,000 refugees did find sanctuary in Switzerland.

            It took a great deal of courage in the dead of winter of 1942-'43 for this family to make four attempts to cross the border. Fortunately, the last attempt was successful. It was only towards the end of the war (when it was clear that Germany would be defeated) that Swiss border crossing policies eased somewhat.

            In the wake of the German occupation of the entirety of France in November 1942, the persecution of Jews in the large city of Toulouse, located in southwestern France on the Garonne river, increased. Some 6,400 were arrested and deported from Toulouse and the surrounding areas. The majority, like Mrs. Johles's brother and his family, were foreign Jews. Nearly every one of those deported were murdered.
