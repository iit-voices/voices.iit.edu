It may be considered in favor of Rumkowski that he didn't permit theft. What does it mean, he didn't permit theft? Enough was stolen because whoever had a hand and a leg stole. But at least the ration that was allotted to every person, this at least everbody received. It was organized in this way. There was a warehouse. There in this warehouse the allotment of food was received. For example, the street [section] from Podrzeizna to Polska was assigned to the twentieth district-warehouse.

There were among them Jews who even had served in the German army. When we asked them why they were sent to the <a class="placename" href="#vothC65" type="camp">Ghetto</a> they said that the Germans want to protect them from the bombs, because where they are [from], there are severe bombings and here there are no bombings. You know the German Jews! In such a way people were deceived. In short, a field was alloted to them in God's acre. Thousands and thousands of them died. Because we, the Polish Jews, became adapted to it little by little . . . It became worse by degrees. And they who entered Gehenna directly from affluence were strewn over the field . . .</span>

                By November 24, 1941 the heart of Theresienstadt was turned into a walled ghetto. To the outside it was presented by the Nazis as a model Jewish settlement, but in reality it was a concentration camp. Theresienstadt was also used as a transit camp for European Jews en route to Auschwitz.

Built upon the Nazi racial ideology, the SS, under Heinrich Himmler's command, was responsible for many (and most of the worst) of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.
