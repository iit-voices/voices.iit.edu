We were forced to keep our coats on in the biggest mud: "This is what you have to do!" We worked for three hours.

One cannot walk in the town at night." We asked that we be released, because we had just finished our work. They let us [go]. A Jew, who owned a restaurant near the train, took us home with him. Locked! So he knocked on the gate. A woman comes out and says, "Why did you come? Have mercy! Today six hundred and fifty Jews were killed. You came at the absolutely worst time." "Where?" we asked. "Who knows that Jews were killed? Who? What kind of Jews?" "They took both rabbis, all the lawyers, their daughters and their sons and their children and killed them." "Well, let us in." And we were admitted. And we spent the whole night hidden in the attic. In the morning two <a class="term" href="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</a> men came and asked, "Where are the men who arrived last night? The woman stood outside and says, "There are no men here. No one came." He asked, "Aren't you lying?" She says, "No." Well, we continued, and we lay there until the evening before Yom Kippur. On Yom Kippur Eve, we went to the synagogue to pray. We prayed there and the next morning, the next morning, there came an order that the whole street has to be evacuated.</span>

All three synagogues were burning, and the order came that we had to go out into the street. So everyone gathered together, everyone who was able to—[even] small children—and they ran outside the city. And it burned a whole day; it burned and burned and burned until twelve o'clock at night, Sukkos Eve at night. At twelve o'clock it became quiet and at four o'clock in the morning the Red Army came in.</span>
